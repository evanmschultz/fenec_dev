# üêç Fenec Python Parser

The Python Parser in Fenec is responsible for analyzing Python source code and constructing structured representations of the code using the Model Builders. It leverages the `libcst` library to parse Python code and create a comprehensive model of the code structure.

## üåü Features

-   üìÇ File-based parsing of Python source code
-   üîç Detailed analysis of Python modules, classes, functions, and standalone code blocks
-   üèóÔ∏è Integration with Model Builders for constructing hierarchical code representations
-   üîó Support for maintaining parent-child relationships between code elements
-   üîÑ Flexible parsing process adaptable to different code structures

> **NOTE:** The Python Parser is an internal component of Fenec used for code analysis and model construction. It is not meant for direct interaction by end-users. The documentation is provided for reference and internal development purposes and should be used for diagnosing issues, extending Fenec's functionality, or gaining a better understanding of how Fenec works.

## üß© Core Components

### PythonParser

The main class responsible for parsing Python source code:

-   `__init__(self, file_path: str)`: Initializes the parser with a file path.
-   `open_file(self) -> str`: Reads and returns the contents of the specified Python file.
-   `parse(self, code: str, parent_id: str) -> ModuleModelBuilder | None`: Parses the provided code and returns a ModuleModelBuilder instance.

### Key Dependencies

-   **libcst**: Used for parsing Python code into a Concrete Syntax Tree (CST).
-   **ModuleVisitor**: A custom visitor class that traverses the CST and constructs the module model.
-   **BuilderFactory**: Used to create appropriate model builders for different code elements.
-   **ID Generation Strategies**: Used to generate unique identifiers for code elements.

## üöÄ Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the Python Parser:

```python
from fenec.python_parser.python_parser import PythonParser

# Initialize the parser with a file path
parser = PythonParser("/path/to/your/python_file.py")

# Read the file contents
code = parser.open_file()

# Parse the code
module_builder = parser.parse(code, parent_id="parent_module_id")

if module_builder:
    # Build the module model
    module_model, child_models = module_builder.build()

    # Now you have a structured representation of your Python file
    print(f"Module Name: {module_model.file_path}")
    print(f"Number of children: {len(module_model.children_ids)}")
else:
    print("Failed to parse the module")
```

## üîÑ Integration with Other Components

The Python Parser works closely with other Fenec components:

-   **Model Builders**: The parser uses various model builders to construct representations of different code elements.
-   **Visitors**: Custom visitor classes (like ModuleVisitor) are used to traverse the CST and populate the model builders.
-   **ID Generation Strategies**: These are used to create unique identifiers for each code element.

## üöß Under Development

The Python Parser in Fenec is under active development. Current areas of focus include:

-   Testing, and error handling to ensure robustness and reliability
-   Improving parsing performance for large Python files, if necessary, this can include parallelization or concurrent processing
-   Enhancing support for more complex Python language features
-   Refining the integration between the parser and model builders
