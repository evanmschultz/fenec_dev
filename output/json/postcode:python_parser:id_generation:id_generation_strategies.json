INITIAL SUMMARY: Start by generating a high-level summary of the code. This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\nand purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm to return a list of integers sorted in ascending order.\"\\n\\n2. IDENTIFY MISSING KEY COMPONENTS: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, classes, etc.\\n\\n3. INCORPORATE MISSING COMPONENTS: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative and explains the\\nfunctionality and purpose of the code even better. Ensure that the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a \\nquicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and partitioning logic to return a list of integers in ascending order.\"\\n\\n4. REPEAT THE PROCESS: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code and getting better detail on its purpose without becoming \\nlonger.\\n\\n5. FINAL SUMMARY: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code, and include detailed information on the code\\'s purpose.
