The `LOCAL_IMPORT_AND_DEPENDENCY_SUMMARIES` are summaries of all the \ncode blocks defined locally in the overarching project that the `CODE` depends on or uses to accomplish its intended task. Use these summaries to help \nwrite your summary of the `CODE`, directly referencing the imports the `CODE` depends on. If summaries are missing for the dependencies,\ndo not infer or make assumptions about their content, beyond what the code directly implies their purpose is. Instead, write your summary based on \nthe code and summaries provided.\n\nIf the code is for a function, or class, specifically reference the function or class name, and any names defined inside of it, in your summary.\n\nChain of Density Steps:\n\n1. INITIAL SUMMARY: Start by generating a high-level summary of the code. This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \nand purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm to return a list of integers sorted in ascending order.\"\n\n2.

REPEAT THE PROCESS: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code and getting better detail on its purpose without becoming \nlonger.\n\n5. FINAL SUMMARY: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \nalgorithms, and structures used in the code, and include detailed information on the code's purpose.
