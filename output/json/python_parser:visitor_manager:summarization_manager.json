Your summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code's purpose, main\\nfeatures, and key components.\\n\", 'role': 'system'}, {'content': 'Prompt: \"Summarize the code provided.\"\\n\\nChain of Density Steps:\\n\\n1. **Initial Summary**: Start by generating a high-level summary of the code. This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\n\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\n\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\npartitioning logic.\"\\n\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\n\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\'s content.\\n\\nGuidelines:\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\'s functionality.\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\'s main functionality.\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\n\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE`.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\npartitioning logic.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s content.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGuidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s main functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES` and `LOCAL_IMPORT_AND_DEPENDENCY_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE` and code blocks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthe `CODE` depends upon.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\npartitioning logic.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s content.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGuidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s main functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE`.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\npartitioning logic.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s content.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGuidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s main functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES` and `LOCAL_IMPORT_AND_DEPENDENCY_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE` and code blocks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthe `CODE` depends upon.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\npartitioning logic.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s content.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGuidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s main functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE`.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\npartitioning logic.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s content.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGuidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s main functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES` and `LOCAL_IMPORT_AND_DEPENDENCY_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE` and code blocks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthe `CODE` depends upon.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\npartitioning logic.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s content.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGuidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s main functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE`.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\npartitioning logic.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s content.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGuidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s main functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE`.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\npartitioning logic.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary.

For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\npartitioning logic.\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s content.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGuidelines:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s main functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE`.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\\\\\\\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\\\\\\\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\\\\\\\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\\\\\\\npartitioning logic.\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\\\\\\\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\\\\\\\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s content.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGuidelines:\\\\\\\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s functionality.\\\\\\\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\\\\\\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s main functionality.\\\\\\\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES` and `LOCAL_IMPORT_AND_DEPENDENCY_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE` and code blocks\\\\\\\\nthe `CODE` depends upon.

This summary should briefly describe the main functionality \\nor purpose of the code. For example, \"This code implements a basic sorting algorithm.\"\\n\\n2. **Identify Missing Key Components**: After creating the initial summary, identify 1-3 key components that are missing from the summary. These \\ncomponents could be specific functions, algorithms, data structures, or important variables used in the code.\\n\\n3. **Incorporate Missing Components**: Rewrite the summary to include the identified components, making it more detailed and informative. Ensure \\nthat the length of the summary does not increase. For example, \"This code implements a quicksort algorithm using a pivot selection function and \\npartitioning logic.\"\\n\\n4. **Repeat the Process**: Continue this process, identifying missing components and integrating them into the summary in each iteration. After \\neach iteration, the summary should become more detailed, covering more aspects of the code without becoming longer.\\n\\n5. **Final Summary**: After 5 iterations, the final summary should be dense with technical details and accurately reflect the key functionalities, \\nalgorithms, and structures used in the code. It should provide a clear and concise overview of the code\\'s content.\\n\\nGuidelines:\\n- Ensure that each iteration of the summary accurately reflects the code\\'s functionality.\\n- The summary should be technical yet understandable, providing a clear picture of the code\\'s purpose, main features, and key components.\\n- Avoid technical jargon that is not directly relevant to the code\\'s main functionality.\\n- The final summary should be comprehensive yet concise, capturing the essence of the code.\\n\\nBelow the code are summaries, `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES` and `LOCAL_IMPORT_AND_DEPENDENCY_SUMMARIES`, from the children in the `CODE` and code blocks\\nthe `CODE` depends upon.
