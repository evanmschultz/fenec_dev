## 🎯 Project Vision

Fenec is an experimental Python library aimed at enhancing code comprehension and interaction through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). We're exploring innovative approaches to parsing, summarizing, and querying Python projects. Your contributions can help shape the future of AI-assisted code analysis and interaction.
