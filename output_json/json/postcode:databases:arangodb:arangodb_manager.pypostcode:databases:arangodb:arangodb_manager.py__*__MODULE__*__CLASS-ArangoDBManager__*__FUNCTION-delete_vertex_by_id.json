    "summary": "\nThe `delete_vertex_by_id` method, within an unspecified class, interacts with a graph database through a `db_connector` to remove a vertex by key. It leverages `_get_collection_name_from_id` for collection name retrieval, defaults to a class attribute for the graph name if absent, and deletes the vertex using the graph API's `vertex_collection` method. The method handles unknown vertex types and exceptions by logging errors and is annotated to return nothing. It also contains a commented-out line for success logging.",
