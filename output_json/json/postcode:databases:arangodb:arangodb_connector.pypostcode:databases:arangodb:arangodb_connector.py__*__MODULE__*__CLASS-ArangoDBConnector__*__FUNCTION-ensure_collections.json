    "summary": "\nThe `ensure_collections` method in the code is designed to prepare a database by creating a set of collections with names obtained from the `pluralized_and_lowered_block_types` helper function. It ensures each collection is created by invoking `ensure_collection` and also establishes an edge collection named \"code_edges\". Although there are indications of schema usage for collections, this feature is currently not implemented in the active code.",
