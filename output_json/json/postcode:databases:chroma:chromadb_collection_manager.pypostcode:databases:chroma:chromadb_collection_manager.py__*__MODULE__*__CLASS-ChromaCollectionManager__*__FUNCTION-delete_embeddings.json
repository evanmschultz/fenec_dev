    "summary": "\nThe `delete_embeddings` method, annotated to receive a list of string IDs, duplicates this list to safely iterate and validate each ID against a collection, logging discrepancies with error and warning levels. It employs a guard clause to exit if no IDs are valid and leverages f-strings for log message clarity. Upon confirming valid IDs, it executes the collection's `delete` method to remove the associated embeddings, as described in the method's docstring, which also includes usage examples.",
