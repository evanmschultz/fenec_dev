    "summary": "This code defines a utility method `_get_module_ids` within a class, designed to extract and return a list of module IDs from a tuple of model objects, specifically targeting instances of the `ModuleModel` class. The primary purpose of this method is to facilitate the identification and extraction of module-specific identifiers, which are crucial for operations such as data extraction, reporting, or further processing tasks within a larger system. Key components include the use of a list comprehension to efficiently iterate over the input tuple `models_tuple`, filtering models that are instances of `ModuleModel` and collecting their `id` attributes. This approach ensures concise and efficient data processing, leveraging Python's built-in list comprehension for performance and readability. The method assumes that each model in the tuple possesses an `id` attribute and that `ModuleModel` is a subclass of `ModelType`, ensuring type safety through the use of the `isinstance` function for type checking.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward, relying solely on Python's core capabilities, such as list comprehensions and type checking with `isinstance`, without the need for external libraries or frameworks. This simplicity enhances the method's portability and ease of integration into various Python-based systems. In the context of a larger project, this method likely serves as a helper function within a class responsible for managing or interacting with a collection of model objects. It plays a critical role in ensuring that operations involving module-specific models are streamlined and efficient, promoting modularity and reusability by encapsulating this functionality within a method. This allows other components of the system to easily access and utilize module IDs as needed, supporting tasks related to model management and ensuring that the system can efficiently handle module-specific operations. Overall, `_get_module_ids` is a crucial part of the codebase, contributing to the system's ability to manage and process model data effectively.",
