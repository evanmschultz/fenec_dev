    "summary": "This code defines the `get_response` method within a class, designed to generate a conversational response to a user's question by leveraging the OpenAI API, specifically tailored for applications in conversational AI. The primary purpose of this method is to take a user's question, format it using a specified prompt template, and retrieve a response from the OpenAI language model. Key components of this method include: a validation check for an empty `user_question` that raises a `ValueError` to ensure input integrity; interaction with a `chroma_librarian` to query relevant documents, which are then used to construct a context string; and the use of a private method `_format_prompt` to prepare the final prompt for the API call. The implementation involves querying the `chroma_librarian` for context, which is expected to return a structured result containing documents. These documents are concatenated into a context string, which is then formatted with the user's question into a prompt. This prompt is sent to the OpenAI API using the `chat.completions.create` method, which returns a response object from which the content is extracted and returned to the user. The method includes robust error handling, raising exceptions such as `ValueError`, `RuntimeError`, and `KeyError` to manage potential issues with input validation, API requests, and template formatting, respectively.\n\nThe technical stack includes the OpenAI API, which is used for generating conversational responses, and a `chroma_librarian` component, which is likely a custom or third-party library for document retrieval, though specific libraries for these components are not explicitly mentioned. The method also utilizes type hinting with Python's typing system to ensure clarity and correctness in data handling, although there is a noted type hinting error that requires fixing. In the context of a larger system, this method is a core component of an AI-driven conversational agent, interfacing with document retrieval systems and the OpenAI API to provide intelligent and contextually relevant responses to user queries. It likely operates within a broader architecture that includes user interface components, additional data processing modules, and possibly other AI models, contributing to a seamless user experience in applications such as virtual assistants, customer support bots, or educational tools. The method's design emphasizes modularity and error resilience, ensuring it can be integrated into complex systems requiring dynamic and context-aware interactions.",
