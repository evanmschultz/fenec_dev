    "summary": "The code snippet defines an abstract method `build` within an abstract base class, serving as a crucial component of a larger framework designed for constructing models of various code blocks, such as modules, classes, and functions. The primary purpose of this method is to enforce a contract for subclasses, ensuring they implement the necessary logic to build and return a `CodeBlockModel` object. This method is integral to the `BaseModelBuilder` class, which employs the builder pattern to provide a structured approach for assembling code block models with shared attributes and methods. Key components of this system include the `BaseModelBuilder` class itself, which contains methods like `set_start_line_num`, `set_end_line_num`, `set_code_content`, `add_important_comment`, `add_summary`, `add_child_builder`, `set_dependencies`, `update_import_dependency`, `build_children`, `set_children_ids`, and `_get_common_attributes`. These methods facilitate the setting of attributes, management of dependencies, and construction of hierarchical models of code blocks.\n\nThe implementation leverages the builder pattern, allowing for the incremental construction of code block models. It uses lists and dictionaries to manage child builders and common attributes, respectively, supporting operations such as setting line numbers, adding comments, managing dependencies, and building child models. This design pattern ensures flexibility and extensibility, enabling the addition of new types of code blocks without altering the existing structure. The `build` method, marked with the `@abstractmethod` decorator, is a critical component, as it mandates that any subclass must provide a concrete implementation, promoting consistency and reusability across different implementations.\n\nThe technical stack primarily involves Python's built-in `abc` module, which provides tools for defining abstract base classes and methods. The code implies the use of custom types like `BlockType`, `ImportModel`, `DependencyModel`, `CommentModel`, and `BaseCodeBlockModel`, which are likely defined elsewhere in the system. These custom types suggest a comprehensive framework for modeling code structures, where each type plays a specific role in representing different aspects of code blocks.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this abstract method fits into a framework or library where different types of code block models are constructed, ensuring that all models conform to a standard interface. This design facilitates polymorphism and allows for the extension of the system with new model types without altering existing code. The `BaseModelBuilder` class and its `build` method are foundational components that enable the creation of complex, hierarchical representations of code, supporting tasks such as code analysis, transformation, and documentation generation within the broader software development lifecycle. This framework likely interacts with other components such as parsers, analyzers, and documentation generators, forming a cohesive system for managing and manipulating code structures in a scalable and maintainable manner.",
