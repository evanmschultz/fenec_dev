    "summary": "This code defines a method `_get_local_dependency_summary` within a class, designed to retrieve a summary of a local dependency for use in prompts, which is crucial for understanding the relationships and dependencies within a codebase. The main functionality of this method is to determine if a specified dependency, represented by a `DependencyModel`, is a local dependency of a given model, denoted by `ModelType`, and to return its summary if it is indeed local. Key components include: `DependencyModel` and `ModelType`, which are likely custom data structures representing dependencies and models, respectively; `graph_manager`, a component responsible for managing and accessing model vertices by their IDs, indicating a graph-based architecture; and `DirectoryModel`, a class used to identify directory-type models, which are excluded from having summaries returned. The implementation involves iterating over the `children_ids` of the model to find a match with the `code_block_id` of the dependency. Upon finding a match, it retrieves the corresponding model using `graph_manager.get_vertex_model_by_id`. If the retrieved model is not an instance of `DirectoryModel`, it returns the model's summary, employing conditional checks and type checking to ensure the correct type of model is processed. The technical stack, while not explicitly detailed, likely includes a custom framework for managing dependencies and models, possibly within a larger system focused on code analysis or dependency management. This method fits into a larger project by interacting with a graph-based model management system, facilitating the retrieval of dependency summaries, which is essential for code analysis, documentation, or dependency resolution tasks. The use of a graph manager suggests integration with a broader system that models code dependencies as a graph, allowing for efficient traversal and querying of relationships between code components. This method enhances the system's capability to provide detailed insights into code dependencies, supporting tasks such as automated documentation generation, impact analysis, and dependency resolution within a software development environment.",
