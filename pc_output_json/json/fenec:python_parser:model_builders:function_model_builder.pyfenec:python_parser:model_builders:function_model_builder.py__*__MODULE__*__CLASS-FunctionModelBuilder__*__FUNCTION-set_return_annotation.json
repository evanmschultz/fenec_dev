    "summary": "This code is a method within a class, likely named `FunctionModelBuilder`, which is part of a system designed for constructing and modifying function models, potentially in the context of API modeling or dynamic code generation. The primary purpose of the `set_return_annotation` method is to update the return type annotation of a function model by setting the `returns` attribute of the `function_attributes` object associated with the class instance. This functionality is significant in systems that require flexible and programmatically defined function signatures, allowing for dynamic specification of return types.\n\nKey components of this code include the `set_return_annotation` method itself, which takes a `return_type` parameter of type `str` and returns the instance of the `FunctionModelBuilder` class. This enables method chaining through a fluent interface design pattern, enhancing code usability and readability by allowing multiple method calls to be linked in a single statement. The implementation involves a straightforward assignment operation where the `return_type` is directly assigned to the `returns` attribute of the `function_attributes` object, followed by returning `self` to support the fluent interface.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, as the code does not explicitly utilize external libraries or frameworks, suggesting it is part of a custom-built system focused on lightweight and efficient code. This design choice allows the method to integrate seamlessly into a larger codebase without external dependencies, indicating a preference for simplicity and directness in its implementation. The method is likely part of an object-oriented design where function models are constructed and manipulated through a series of builder methods.\n\nIn the context of a larger project, this method likely interacts with other components responsible for constructing or managing function models, contributing to a system that requires dynamic or programmatic function definition and annotation. This could be part of a code generation tool, an API documentation system, or a framework that supports dynamic function creation and modification. The method's role in setting return type annotations is crucial for ensuring that function models are accurately defined and documented, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and usability of the system's API or code generation capabilities. By enabling dynamic return type specification, this method supports the adaptability and extensibility of the system, allowing it to accommodate a wide range of use cases and evolving requirements.",
