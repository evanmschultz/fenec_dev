    "summary": "This code is part of a module management system designed to handle and update import statements within a framework that builds and manages modules, specifically focusing on adjusting local imports to ensure correct import paths and names. The primary purpose of this code is to facilitate accurate module resolution and dependency management by updating import statements for local modules within a given builder context. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of module dependencies and ensuring that the system can accurately resolve and manage imports across different modules.\n\nKey components of this code include the `_update_import_for_builder` method, which is responsible for updating a single import model by determining if the import is local and adjusting the import path and names accordingly. The `_is_local_import` function checks if an import is local to the module, while `_get_import_path` and `_get_import_names` retrieve the import path and names, respectively. The `_should_skip_builder` function decides if a particular builder should be skipped during the update process, ensuring that only relevant builders are processed.\n\nThe implementation involves iterating over a tuple of model builders, checking conditions to skip certain builders, and updating the import model with the correct path and names if applicable. This is achieved through a procedural approach with conditional logic. The code first checks if an import is local using `_is_local_import`. If it is, it retrieves the import path and potentially the import names, depending on whether the import is from another module. The code then iterates over a collection of builders, using `_should_skip_builder` to determine if the current builder should be processed. If not skipped, the `_update_import_model` method is called to apply the necessary updates to the import model.\n\nThe technical stack is not explicitly detailed in the code, but it likely involves custom classes such as `ModuleModelBuilder` and `ImportModel`, which are crucial for the operation of this function. These classes are presumably part of a larger framework or library that handles module and import management, possibly within a Python-based application or system. The code may also utilize standard Python libraries for handling data structures and conditional logic.\n\nIn the context of a larger project, this code is integral to a module or package management system, ensuring that import statements are correctly configured, particularly for local modules. This functionality is essential for maintaining the integrity of module dependencies and ensuring that the system can accurately resolve and manage imports across different modules. The code likely interacts with other components responsible for module creation, dependency analysis, and possibly code generation or compilation, forming a critical part of the overall module management infrastructure. This ensures seamless integration and functionality within the larger system, supporting the dynamic and accurate management of module dependencies.",
