    "summary": "The code is designed to facilitate a multi-pass code summarization task, specifically aimed at generating detailed and structured summaries of Python code for integration into a vector search system. Its primary purpose is to guide an expert code analyst through a structured, multi-stage process to create comprehensive summaries that accurately capture the essence of the code's functionality, structure, and purpose. Key components include: EXAMPLE_1 and EXAMPLE_2, which serve as sample summaries illustrating the expected format and level of detail; CODE_SUMMARY_PROMPT_PASS_1, CODE_SUMMARY_PROMPT_PASS_2, and CODE_SUMMARY_PROMPT_PASS_3, which are sequential prompts that guide the summarization process through initial, detailed, and final passes, respectively. The implementation follows a step-by-step approach where each pass builds upon the previous one, refining and expanding the summary with more technical details and contextual relevance. The technical stack is not explicitly mentioned, as the code primarily focuses on the summarization process rather than specific technologies. In the context of a larger system, this code acts as a framework for generating high-quality code summaries that can be embedded into a vector search system, thereby enhancing the retrieval and understanding of code functionalities within a larger codebase or project. The code also includes a default summarizer instruction and description, which provide a concise overview of the summarizer's task and purpose. The summary_prompt_list variable aggregates all the example summaries and prompts, serving as a reference for the summarization process. This code is integral to a larger system that requires precise and semantically rich code summaries to improve code search and comprehension across extensive codebases, ensuring that users can efficiently locate and understand relevant code segments.",
