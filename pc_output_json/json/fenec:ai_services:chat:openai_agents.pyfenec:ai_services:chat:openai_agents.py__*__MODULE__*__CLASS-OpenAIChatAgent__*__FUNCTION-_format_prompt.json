    "summary": "This code defines a method `_format_prompt` that is integral to dynamically generating prompts for the OpenAI API by embedding user-specific context and questions into a predefined template. The primary purpose of this function is to ensure that the input is structured according to the template's requirements, thereby facilitating seamless and effective communication with the API. Key components include the `_format_prompt` function itself, which takes three parameters: `context`, `user_question`, and `prompt_template`. The function employs Python's string `format` method to replace placeholders in the `prompt_template` with the provided `context` and `user_question`, ensuring that the generated prompt is both contextually relevant and syntactically correct. A `KeyError` is raised if the template lacks necessary keys, providing a robust error-handling mechanism to manage incomplete data inputs.\n\nThe implementation leverages Python's built-in string formatting capabilities, which are efficient and widely adopted for such tasks, eliminating the need for external libraries. This reflects a design pattern focused on simplicity and reliability, ensuring that the function can be seamlessly integrated into larger systems without additional dependencies. The technical stack is minimal, relying solely on Python's core features, which enhances portability and ease of maintenance.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this function likely serves as a utility within a conversational AI or chatbot application. It interfaces with a vector search system, such as Chroma, to retrieve relevant context, which is then formatted for API consumption. This integration is crucial for enabling the backend AI model to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries. By acting as a bridge between the user interface and the AI model, the `_format_prompt` function plays a significant role in enhancing the system's overall functionality and user experience. Its design ensures that the prompts sent to the OpenAI API are well-structured, thereby improving the quality of interactions and the relevance of the responses generated by the AI. This function is a critical component in the pipeline that transforms raw user input and contextual data into a format that the AI model can process effectively, ultimately contributing to the system's ability to deliver precise and meaningful responses.",
