    "summary": "This code is a component of a system designed to generate detailed summaries of dependencies for various model types, enhancing codebase understanding and maintenance through documentation or prompt generation. Its primary function is to extract, compile, and return a formatted string of dependency summaries for a given model, or return `None` if no dependencies are present. Key components include the `_get_dependencies_summaries` method, which orchestrates the entire process of gathering dependency summaries; `_get_import_summary`, a helper function that retrieves summaries for import statements; and `_get_local_dependency_summary`, which processes local dependencies. The implementation involves a type-checking mechanism to determine the appropriate method for gathering dependencies based on the model type. For `ModuleModel` instances, it processes import statements, while for other models, it examines both `DependencyModel` and `ImportModel` instances. The results are compiled into a list and converted into a string using the `_stringify_dependencies_summaries` method, ensuring a structured and readable output.\n\nThe technical stack is primarily based on Python, leveraging its type hinting and object-oriented programming principles to ensure clarity and maintainability. The code likely utilizes Python's standard library for type checking and list operations, although specific external libraries are not explicitly mentioned. This code fits into a larger code analysis or documentation generation tool, interacting with other components that manage models and their metadata. Its role is crucial in providing a concise overview of a model's dependencies, facilitating a deeper understanding of the codebase's structure and interdependencies. By integrating with other components that handle model metadata, this function aids in maintaining an organized and well-documented system, which is essential for large-scale software projects.",
