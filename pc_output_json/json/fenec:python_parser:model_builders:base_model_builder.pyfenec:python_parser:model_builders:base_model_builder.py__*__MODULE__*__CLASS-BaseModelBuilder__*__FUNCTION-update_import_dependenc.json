    "summary": "The code defines a method `update_import_dependency` within a class that is part of a sophisticated model-building framework, designed to manage and update import dependencies within a model instance. Its primary purpose is to ensure that the import dependencies of a model are current and accurate by replacing an outdated import model with a new one, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and functionality of the model-building process. Key components of this method include the `update_import_dependency` function itself, which takes two arguments: `new_import_model` and `old_import_model`, both instances of the `ImportModel` class. The method returns an instance of one of several builder classes, such as `BaseModelBuilder`, `ModuleModelBuilder`, `ClassModelBuilder`, or `FunctionModelBuilder`, indicating its integration with a larger model-building framework.\n\nThe implementation involves iterating over the `dependencies` attribute of `common_attributes`, which is a list of import models associated with the model instance. The method identifies the import model to be replaced by matching the `import_names`, `imported_from`, and `import_module_type` attributes of the `old_import_model` with those of the existing import models. Once the matching import model is found, it is removed from the dependencies list, and the new import model is appended. This process ensures that the model's dependencies are updated without duplicating entries, using Python's list operations for efficient manipulation. The method also includes a check to skip instances of `DependencyModel`, indicating a distinction between different types of dependencies.\n\nThe technical stack primarily involves Python's standard library, with the use of type hints and possibly custom classes like `ImportModel` and `DependencyModel` for managing import dependencies. The method is part of a larger system that employs the builder pattern, as evidenced by its return type, which includes various builder classes. This pattern allows for the incremental and flexible construction of code block models, supporting operations such as setting attributes, managing dependencies, and building hierarchical models of code blocks.\n\nIn the context of the larger project, this method is a component of an abstract base class `BaseModelBuilder`, which serves as a foundational element for constructing models of various code blocks, such as modules, classes, and functions. The `BaseModelBuilder` class implements the builder pattern, providing a structured approach to assembling code block models with shared attributes and methods. The `update_import_dependency` method interacts with other components by ensuring that the dependencies are correctly updated, which is essential for the subsequent stages of model building and execution. This integration is vital for maintaining the accuracy and functionality of the models being constructed, as it ensures that all dependencies are up-to-date and correctly referenced within the model-building framework.",
