    "summary": "The code is part of the `OpenAISummarizer` class, which is designed to facilitate the summarization of code snippets using OpenAI's language models. The primary purpose of the `_create_messages_list` method is to construct a list of chat messages formatted for use with OpenAI's chat completion models. This method is essential for preparing inputs that the chat model can process, ensuring that the messages adhere to the expected structure required by the OpenAI API, thereby enabling effective communication with the language model.\n\nKey components of this method include the `_create_system_message` and `_create_user_message` functions. These functions are responsible for converting raw message strings into instances of `ChatCompletionMessageParam`, a class that likely encapsulates the necessary parameters for message handling in the chat model. The `_create_messages_list` method orchestrates the creation of this message list by calling these helper methods to transform the input strings into the appropriate message objects and then aggregating them into a list.\n\nThe implementation of this method is straightforward, leveraging Python's list data structure to compile the messages. It employs a simple yet effective design pattern where helper methods ensure that each message is correctly formatted before being added to the list. This approach promotes code reusability and ensures that the message creation process is modular and easily maintainable, allowing for seamless integration with the OpenAI API.\n\nThe technical stack includes the OpenAI API, which is central to the operation of the `OpenAISummarizer` class. The API facilitates interaction with OpenAI's language models, and custom classes such as `ChatCompletionSystemMessageParam`, `ChatCompletionUserMessageParam`, and `ChatCompletionMessageParam` are utilized for handling message parameters. These classes are likely part of a larger framework or library that ensures messages are correctly structured and formatted for the API.\n\nIn the context of the larger project, this method is a utility function within the `OpenAISummarizer` class, playing a critical role in the code summarization process. It fits into a broader system that supports multi-pass summarization, allowing for enhanced context-awareness and detail in the generated summaries. The method interacts with other components of the class, such as `_create_prompt` for generating summarization prompts and `_get_summary` for retrieving summaries from the OpenAI API. This integration ensures that the summarization process is seamless and efficient, with the `_create_messages_list` method providing the necessary message formatting to facilitate effective communication with the language model.",
