    "summary": "This code is part of a sophisticated system designed for analyzing and transforming Python code by extracting module names from import statements within an abstract syntax tree (AST). Its primary purpose is to facilitate code analysis tasks such as dependency tracking, refactoring, and static analysis by providing a reliable method to access module names from import statements. The key component of this code is the `_get_import_name` function, which is responsible for retrieving the name of a module from a `libcst.Import` node. This function takes a `libcst.Import` node as input and returns the module name as a string, utilizing the `common_functions.extract_code_content` method to accurately extract the code content of the first import name within the node. This ensures precise retrieval of the module name, which is essential for subsequent analysis or transformation processes.\n\nThe implementation leverages the `libcst` library, which is specifically designed for parsing and manipulating Python code as concrete syntax trees, allowing for precise and reliable code transformations. The `common_functions` module provides utility functions like `extract_code_content`, which aids in extracting specific code elements from CST nodes, enhancing the modularity and reusability of the code. This design pattern promotes separation of concerns, where the extraction logic is decoupled from the main function, allowing for easier maintenance and potential extension of functionality.\n\nIn the context of a larger code analysis or transformation system, this function is likely part of a module that processes import statements to gather information about code dependencies or to facilitate code refactoring. It interacts with other components that traverse and manipulate the AST, contributing to tasks such as code linting, formatting, or static analysis. By integrating with a broader system, this function supports the automation of code quality checks and the enforcement of coding standards, ultimately improving the maintainability and reliability of Python codebases. This integration is crucial for systems that aim to automate and streamline the process of code review and quality assurance in software development environments.",
