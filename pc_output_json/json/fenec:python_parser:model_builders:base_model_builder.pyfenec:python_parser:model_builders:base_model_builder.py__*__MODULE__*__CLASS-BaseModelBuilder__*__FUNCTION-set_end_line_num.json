    "summary": "The code snippet defines the `set_end_line_num` method within an abstract base class `BaseModelBuilder`, which is part of a sophisticated model-building framework designed to construct detailed representations of code structures, such as modules, classes, and functions. The primary purpose of this method is to set the end line number for a code block model instance, a crucial step in accurately defining the boundaries of code elements during source code analysis or transformation tasks. This functionality is significant as it ensures precise metadata association with code blocks, facilitating operations like code navigation, refactoring, and documentation generation.\n\nKey components of this method include the `set_end_line_num` function itself, which accepts an integer `line_num` as a parameter and updates the `end_line_num` attribute within `common_attributes`. This shared data structure is likely used across different model builders to store common metadata. The method returns an instance of the class it belongs to, enabling method chainingâ€”a design pattern commonly used in fluent interfaces to allow for more readable and concise code.\n\nThe implementation of `set_end_line_num` involves a straightforward assignment operation that updates the model's metadata, ensuring the end line number is correctly recorded. This method is part of a polymorphic design, as indicated by its return type hint, which includes multiple builder classes such as `BaseModelBuilder`, `ModuleModelBuilder`, `ClassModelBuilder`, and `FunctionModelBuilder`. This design allows these builders to share common functionality, promoting code reuse and flexibility within the framework.\n\nThe technical stack primarily involves Python, utilizing modern features such as type hinting and union types to enhance code clarity and maintainability. The use of abstract base classes (`ABC`) enforces the implementation of essential methods like `build` in derived classes, ensuring a consistent interface across different model builders. Although the code does not explicitly mention external libraries, it likely integrates with custom types such as `BlockType`, `ImportModel`, `DependencyModel`, `CommentModel`, and `BaseCodeBlockModel`, which are defined elsewhere in the system to support the comprehensive modeling of code structures.\n\nIn the context of the larger project, this method is a crucial component of the `BaseModelBuilder` class, which implements the builder pattern to facilitate the incremental construction of code block models. It interacts with other methods within the class, such as `set_start_line_num`, `set_code_content`, and `add_important_comment`, to build a detailed and hierarchical representation of code blocks. This framework is likely part of a larger code analysis or generation system, interfacing with components responsible for parsing source code, managing dependencies, and generating documentation or other artifacts. The modular and extensible design of the `BaseModelBuilder` class allows for the seamless integration of new code block types, supporting the evolving needs of the system.",
