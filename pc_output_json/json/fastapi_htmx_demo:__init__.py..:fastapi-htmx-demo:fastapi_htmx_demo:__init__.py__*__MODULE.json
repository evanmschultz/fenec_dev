    "summary": "This code defines a Python class named `ChainOfDensitySteps` that appears to manage a sequence of density-related operations or transformations. The class likely includes methods to initialize the sequence, add steps, and execute the chain of steps. The code structure suggests a modular approach, where each step in the chain can be independently defined and then combined to form a comprehensive process. The class interacts with other components or dependencies, which are summarized in the `CHILDREN_SUMMARIES` and `LOCAL_IMPORT_AND_DEPENDENCY_SUMMARIES` sections, indicating a reliance on both local and external modules. The overall purpose of the code is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for performing a series of density-related computations or transformations in a structured manner.",
