    "summary": "The `OpenAIReturnContext` class is a Python dataclass designed to encapsulate metadata associated with the completion process of an OpenAI API call. Its primary purpose is to facilitate efficient tracking and management of token usage, which is crucial for applications that require detailed insights into AI-generated text, such as monitoring token consumption for cost management or analyzing generated content for quality assurance. This class is significant in systems that interact with OpenAI's API, providing a structured way to capture and analyze the output of AI-generated text.\n\nKey components of this code include the `OpenAIReturnContext` class itself, which is a dataclass that automatically generates special methods like `__init__()` and `__repr__()`, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing readability. The class contains three attributes: `prompt_tokens`, an integer that records the number of tokens in the input prompt; `completion_tokens`, an integer that indicates the number of tokens in the generated completion; and `summary`, a string or `None` that holds a brief summary of the code snippet, providing optional contextual information about the completion.\n\nThe implementation leverages Python's `dataclasses` module, part of the standard library, to streamline the class definition. This module is used to ensure immutability and type safety, making the code more robust and easier to maintain. The use of type annotations (`int` and `str | None`) further enhances the code's clarity and reliability by explicitly defining the expected data types for each attribute. This approach ensures that the data structure is both lightweight and efficient, focusing on core functionality without unnecessary complexity.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, relying solely on Python's standard library, specifically the `dataclasses` module. This choice reflects a design decision to keep the implementation lightweight and focused, avoiding external dependencies that could complicate deployment or integration.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this code is likely part of a framework or application that interacts with OpenAI's API. It provides a structured way to capture and analyze the output of AI-generated text, which can be crucial for systems that need to log, monitor, or optimize the completion process. This class may interface with logging systems to record token usage, analytics tools to assess completion quality, or user interfaces that display detailed information about the completion process to end-users. By encapsulating this metadata, the `OpenAIReturnContext` class plays a vital role in managing and understanding the interactions with OpenAI's API, contributing to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.",
