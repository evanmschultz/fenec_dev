    "summary": "The `_get_summary` method is a pivotal function within the `OpenAISummarizer` class, designed to interface with the OpenAI API to generate concise text summaries from a sequence of chat messages. Its primary purpose is to automate the extraction of contextually relevant summaries, leveraging OpenAI's sophisticated language models, which is crucial for applications that require efficient text analysis and summarization. Key components of this method include the `ChatCompletionMessageParam`, which structures the input messages for the API, and the `OpenAIReturnContext`, which encapsulates the API's response details, such as the generated summary and token usage statistics. The implementation involves invoking the `chat.completions.create` method from the OpenAI client, which processes the input messages using configuration settings specified in the `configs` attribute, such as model type, maximum token count, and temperature, to influence the behavior of text generation. The response is parsed to extract the summary content and token usage, which are then encapsulated in an `OpenAIReturnContext` object. The method includes robust error handling, logging exceptions, and returning `None` in case of errors, ensuring stability and reliability against potential API failures.\n\nThe technical stack primarily involves the OpenAI API, which provides the natural language processing capabilities necessary for generating summaries. Additionally, Python's logging module is utilized for error management, ensuring that any issues during API interactions are recorded for debugging purposes. Within the larger context of the `OpenAISummarizer` class, this method is part of a comprehensive system designed for multi-pass code summarization. It interacts with other components such as `_create_system_message`, `_create_user_message`, and `_create_messages_list`, which are responsible for constructing and organizing the messages sent to the API. The class also includes methods like `summarize_code`, which orchestrates the summarization process with multi-pass support, allowing for iterative refinement and enhanced detail in the generated summaries. This method fits into a broader workflow where it supports the summarization of code snippets by integrating with other components that manage chat interactions and data processing workflows, leveraging OpenAI's capabilities for enhanced text analysis and summarization. The overall design supports a modular and extensible architecture, enabling seamless integration with other systems and facilitating the development of sophisticated text processing applications.",
