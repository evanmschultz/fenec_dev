    "summary": "The code is a method within the `OpenAISummarizer` class, designed to facilitate the generation of detailed code summaries using OpenAI's language models. The primary purpose of the `_create_user_message` function is to construct a user message object that adheres to the format required by OpenAI's chat completion API, specifically utilizing the `ChatCompletionUserMessageParam` class. This function is significant as it ensures that user inputs are consistently formatted with a predefined role of \"user\", which is essential for the chat completion engine to accurately process and respond to messages.\n\nKey components of this code include the `_create_user_message` function itself, which accepts a string parameter `content` and returns an instance of `ChatCompletionUserMessageParam`. This instance is initialized with the provided content and a fixed role of \"user\", encapsulating the message creation process to maintain uniformity across all user messages.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward, focusing on encapsulating the logic for message creation within a single function. This design abstracts the complexity of message formatting, ensuring that all user messages conform to the expected structure required by the OpenAI API. By directly instantiating the `ChatCompletionUserMessageParam` with the specified content and role, the function simplifies the process of preparing user inputs for the chat completion engine.\n\nThe technical stack involves OpenAI's API, particularly the `ChatCompletionUserMessageParam` class, which is part of their chat completion framework. This class defines the structure of messages sent to the OpenAI API, playing a crucial role in the interaction between the summarization tool and the language model.\n\nIn the context of the larger `OpenAISummarizer` class, this function is integral to the multi-pass summarization process. It standardizes user input before it is processed by the chat completion engine, ensuring that all messages are formatted correctly. The function interacts with other components such as `_create_system_message` and `_create_messages_list`, which together compile a comprehensive list of messages for chat completion. This interaction is crucial for the summarization workflow, as it ensures that all components work together seamlessly to produce accurate and context-aware summaries. The overall system leverages OpenAI's API for language model interactions, with custom classes and methods facilitating structured message handling and prompt generation. This enhances the summarization process through iterative refinement and context-aware multi-pass summarization, ultimately contributing to the tool's ability to generate detailed and accurate code summaries.",
