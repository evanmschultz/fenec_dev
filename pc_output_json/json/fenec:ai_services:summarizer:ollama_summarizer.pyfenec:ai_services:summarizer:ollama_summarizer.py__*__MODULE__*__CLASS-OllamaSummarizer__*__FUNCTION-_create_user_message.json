    "summary": "This code snippet is a critical component of a chat application, specifically designed to handle the creation of user messages within the system. The primary purpose of the `_create_user_message` method is to generate a structured message object using the `OllamaMessage` TypedDict, which is essential for maintaining a consistent and standardized format for user inputs. This function is significant as it ensures that each user message is encapsulated with the necessary metadata, including the role \"user\" and the provided content, which is crucial for downstream processing and interaction logic within the chat system.\n\nKey components of this implementation include the `_create_user_message` function, which takes a single parameter `content` of type `str`. It returns an instance of `OllamaMessage`, a TypedDict that defines the structure of the message with fields for `content` and `role`. This method exemplifies a straightforward instantiation of the `OllamaMessage` TypedDict, setting the `content` to the provided string and the `role` to \"user\". The design pattern employed here leverages Python's type hinting and TypedDict to enforce a clear and type-safe structure for message objects, enhancing both the readability and maintainability of the code.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, primarily utilizing Python's built-in type hinting and the TypedDict feature from the `typing` module. This approach ensures that the data structure for messages is well-defined and consistent across the application, reducing the likelihood of errors related to message formatting. The use of TypedDict is particularly beneficial in larger systems where message objects are passed between various components, as it provides a clear contract for what a message should contain, thereby facilitating integration and communication between different parts of the system.\n\nIn the context of the larger chat application, this method is likely part of a messaging or communication module that interfaces with other components responsible for message processing, user interaction, and potentially integration with a chat backend or API. The `_create_user_message` function plays a pivotal role in the initial stages of message handling, ensuring that user inputs are correctly formatted and ready for further processing, such as routing to the appropriate handlers, logging, or sending to external services. This function contributes to the overall robustness and reliability of the chat system by providing a consistent and standardized approach to user message creation, which is vital for maintaining seamless communication and interaction within the application.",
