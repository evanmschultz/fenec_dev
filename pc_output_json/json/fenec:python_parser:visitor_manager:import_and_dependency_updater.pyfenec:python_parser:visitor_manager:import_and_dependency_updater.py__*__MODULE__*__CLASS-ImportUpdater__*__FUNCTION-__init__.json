    "summary": "This code defines a constructor method for a class, designed to initialize an instance with a tuple of `ModuleModelBuilder` objects. The primary purpose of this code is to facilitate the dynamic construction or configuration of various modules within a larger system by storing a collection of model builders. Key components include the `__init__` method, which serves as the class constructor, and the `model_builder_tuple` attribute, which is a type-hinted tuple containing instances of `ModuleModelBuilder`. The implementation involves a straightforward assignment of the input tuple to an instance variable, ensuring that the object is initialized with the necessary model builders for subsequent operations. This design pattern supports modularity and flexibility, allowing for the dynamic assembly of system components based on the provided builders. The technical stack primarily involves Python, utilizing its type hinting capabilities to enforce the expected structure of the `model_builder_tuple`. This code is likely part of a larger, modular architecture where different system components or models are constructed or configured at runtime, enhancing the system's scalability and adaptability. It interacts with other parts of the codebase by providing a standardized way to manage and utilize model builders, potentially interfacing with a broader framework that orchestrates the lifecycle of these modules.",
