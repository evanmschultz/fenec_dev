    "summary": "This code is designed to configure a logging system that enhances log outputs with rich text formatting and syntax highlighting, significantly improving readability and debugging efficiency. The primary function, `setup_logging`, is responsible for establishing the logging configuration. It accepts a logging level parameter, defaulting to `logging.INFO`, and applies a specific log format using the `RichHandler` from the Rich library, which supports markup for enhanced log presentation. Key components include the `setup_logging` function, which configures the logging level and format through Python's `logging.basicConfig` function, and the `RichHandler`, which is integrated to enable rich text features in log messages. The implementation involves setting the logging level and format string to `%(message)s`, ensuring that only the message content is displayed, and utilizing the `RichHandler` with the `markup=True` parameter to activate rich text capabilities. The technical stack comprises the Python `logging` module, which provides a flexible framework for log management, and the Rich library, which offers advanced text formatting and syntax highlighting features. In the context of a larger system, this code serves as a utility to standardize and improve log outputs across applications, facilitating better monitoring and debugging by providing visually enriched log information. It can be integrated into various applications within a codebase to ensure consistent and enhanced logging practices, thereby aiding developers in quickly identifying and resolving issues through more informative and visually appealing log messages. This utility is particularly useful in environments where clear and concise log outputs are crucial for maintaining system reliability and performance, such as in large-scale distributed systems or complex software applications.",
