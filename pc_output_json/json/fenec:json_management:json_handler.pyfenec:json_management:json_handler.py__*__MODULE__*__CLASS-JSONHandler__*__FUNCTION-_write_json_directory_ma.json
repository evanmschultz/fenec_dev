    "summary": "The `_write_json_directory_map` function is a private method within the `JSONHandler` class, designed to serialize and persist a directory map as a JSON file. This function is integral to the `JSONHandler` class's broader role of converting and managing code components into structured JSON formats, which is crucial for applications requiring consistent and reliable storage of directory mappings, such as configuration management systems or file organization tools. The primary purpose of this method is to facilitate the standardized storage and retrieval of directory structures, ensuring that directory mappings are easily accessible and maintainable.\n\nKey components of this function include the use of Python's built-in `json` module, specifically leveraging the `json.dump` method to serialize the `directory_modules` attribute into a human-readable JSON file. The function employs an indentation of four spaces to enhance the clarity and readability of the output JSON. The implementation utilizes a context manager (`with` statement) to open the file in write mode, ensuring that the file is properly closed after the write operation, which is a best practice in Python for resource management. This approach not only simplifies the code but also enhances its reliability by automatically handling file closure, even in the event of an error during the write operation.\n\nThe technical stack for this function is minimal, relying solely on Python's standard library. The `json` module is used for its robust capabilities in handling JSON data serialization, while the `open` function is employed for file operations. This simplicity underscores the efficiency and power of Python's standard library in managing common tasks.\n\nIn the context of the larger `JSONHandler` class, the `_write_json_directory_map` method is part of a comprehensive suite of functionalities that manage the conversion, storage, and cleanup of parsed code models. The class employs a structured approach to directory and file management, utilizing the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module for handling file paths and directories, and the `rmtree` function from the `shutil` module for directory cleanup. Additionally, a custom `logging_decorator` is used to log operations, providing transparency and traceability of the file management processes. The design pattern follows a modular approach, encapsulating functionality within methods that handle specific tasks related to JSON file management. This modularity allows for easy maintenance and extension of the class's capabilities, making it a robust component within a larger system that requires organized storage and cleanup of output directories. The `JSONHandler` class, with its methodical approach to JSON file management, plays a critical role in ensuring that directory structures are consistently and accurately represented across the system, facilitating seamless integration with other components that rely on these structured data formats.",
