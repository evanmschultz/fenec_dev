    "summary": "This code defines a method `_get_import_summary` within a class, designed to generate a concise summary of an import statement, which is crucial for dynamically generating documentation or code analysis prompts. The primary purpose of this function is to analyze an `ImportModel` object and return a string summary that describes the import's type and relevance, or `None` if the import is deemed irrelevant. Key components include: the `_get_import_summary` method, which serves as the main entry point for determining the type of import and delegating to specific helper methods; `_get_local_import_summary` and `_get_local_import_from_summary` methods, which handle local imports without and with specific import names, respectively; and `_get_import_details`, which processes non-local imports to construct a detailed summary. The implementation employs conditional logic to differentiate between local and non-local imports, utilizing helper methods to construct the appropriate summary string. This method returns a string summary or `None`, effectively filtering out irrelevant imports and focusing on those that contribute meaningful information to the documentation or analysis.\n\nThe technical stack is primarily based on Python, likely utilizing Python's standard library for handling import models and possibly custom classes or modules for the `ImportModel` class. This suggests a reliance on Python's introspection capabilities and object-oriented design to manage and process import statements effectively. The method's design pattern follows a strategy-like approach, where different strategies (helper methods) are employed based on the import type, ensuring flexibility and extensibility in handling various import scenarios.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this method is part of a code analysis or documentation generation tool, interacting with other components that manage import models and generate comprehensive code summaries. Its role is to provide detailed import information, enhancing the system's ability to produce accurate and informative prompts or documentation. This functionality is integral to systems that require an understanding of code dependencies and structure, such as automated documentation generators, code review tools, or integrated development environments (IDEs) that offer real-time code insights. By providing a structured and detailed import summary, this method contributes to the overall goal of improving code readability and maintainability within the larger project.",
