    "summary": "This code snippet is designed to facilitate the creation of a `DependencyModel` object, which is crucial for managing and understanding the dependencies of a software module within a larger system. The primary function, `_create_module_dependency_model`, takes a single argument, `module_code_block_id`, a string that uniquely identifies a module's code block. This function returns an instance of `DependencyModel`, initialized with the provided code block ID, encapsulating the dependency information for that specific module. The implementation is straightforward, focusing on the instantiation of the `DependencyModel` class, which likely plays a significant role in tracking and managing dependencies across different modules in a software project. This simplicity suggests that `DependencyModel` is a well-defined class, possibly part of a larger framework or custom library designed to handle complex dependency graphs, ensuring that each module's dependencies are accurately represented and managed.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, as the code does not explicitly import or utilize external libraries or frameworks, indicating that `DependencyModel` is either a custom class or part of a larger framework within the project. This minimalistic approach suggests a focus on internal consistency and modularity, where the `DependencyModel` class is likely equipped with methods and attributes to handle various aspects of dependency management, such as dependency resolution, conflict detection, and visualization.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this function is likely part of a dependency management subsystem, interacting with other components that analyze, visualize, or resolve module dependencies. It plays a crucial role in ensuring modularity and maintainability in software development by providing a structured way to represent and manage dependencies. This function could be integrated into a larger pipeline that includes dependency analysis tools, visualization interfaces, and automated resolution mechanisms, contributing to a robust software architecture that supports scalable and maintainable codebases. By encapsulating dependency information in a structured manner, it aids in the seamless integration and interaction of various software components, ensuring that the system remains adaptable and efficient as it evolves.",
