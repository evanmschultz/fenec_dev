    "summary": "This code is part of a system designed to enhance dependency management and code organization by categorizing Python imports, specifically identifying third-party libraries. Its primary function, `_is_third_party_import`, determines whether a given `import_name` is a third-party import by checking its presence in a collection provided by the `_third_party_imports` function. This function likely belongs to a larger module or package that performs import analysis, potentially within a static analysis tool or a build system script. The implementation is straightforward, utilizing a membership test to verify if the `import_name` exists within a set or list of recognized third-party imports, which `_third_party_imports` presumably supplies. This approach ensures efficient and accurate identification of third-party dependencies, which is crucial for maintaining a clean and organized codebase.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, relying on Python's built-in capabilities, but it suggests integration with a broader codebase where `_third_party_imports` is defined. This function may leverage Python's introspection capabilities or a predefined list of third-party packages, possibly maintained in a configuration file or database. Although the snippet does not explicitly import any external libraries, it is likely part of a system that interacts with other components managing or analyzing dependencies, such as a package manager or a continuous integration system.\n\nIn the context of a larger project, this function could be integral to a dependency analysis tool, ensuring that third-party dependencies are correctly identified, managed, and documented. This facilitates better dependency tracking, reduces potential conflicts or redundancies in the project's import structure, and supports automated tools that enforce coding standards or generate dependency reports. By accurately categorizing imports, the system can streamline the development process, enhance code maintainability, and support compliance with organizational or industry standards for software development.",
