    "summary": "The code snippet is part of a `ModuleVisitor` class, which is designed to traverse and construct a model of a Python module's concrete syntax tree (CST) using the `libcst` library. The primary purpose of the `leave_FunctionDef` method is to finalize the construction of a function model by removing the current function model builder from a stack. This stack is crucial for managing the state of nested function definitions or scopes during the CST traversal, ensuring that each function definition is correctly processed and integrated into the overall module representation. \n\nKey components of the `ModuleVisitor` class include various methods for visiting and leaving different CST nodes, such as `visit_Module`, `visit_Import`, `visit_ClassDef`, and `visit_FunctionDef`. Each of these methods is responsible for handling specific parts of the module's structure. The `leave_FunctionDef` method specifically deals with the exit of a `FunctionDef` node, indicating the completion of processing for the current function definition by popping the top element from the `builder_stack`.\n\nThe implementation employs a visitor pattern, a common design pattern for traversing complex data structures like syntax trees. The `builder_stack` data structure is used to maintain the state of function model builders, allowing the system to handle nested structures efficiently. This stack-based approach ensures that the context is correctly managed as the CST is traversed, with each function or class definition having its own builder that is pushed onto the stack when entered and popped when exited.\n\nThe technical stack primarily involves the `libcst` library, which provides tools for parsing and manipulating Python code as a CST. This library is essential for the accurate traversal and modification of Python source code, enabling the `ModuleVisitor` class to build a detailed and structured representation of the module.\n\nIn the context of a larger code analysis or transformation tool, the `leave_FunctionDef` method plays a critical role in managing the state of function definitions. It interacts with other components of the `ModuleVisitor` class that traverse and modify the CST, contributing to the accurate and efficient processing of Python source code. This method ensures that each function is correctly modeled and integrated into the overall representation of the code, supporting the tool's ability to analyze, transform, or refactor Python modules effectively. This functionality is vital for applications such as automated code refactoring, static analysis, or code quality tools, where precise understanding and manipulation of code structure are required.",
