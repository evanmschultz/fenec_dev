    "summary": "This code is part of a class model builder designed to enhance the flexibility and functionality of class model creation by enabling dynamic modification of class attributes and keywords. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the construction and management of class models, allowing developers to dynamically set and potentially expand attributes and keywords, thereby streamlining the process of class model configuration. Key components include the `set_keywords` method, which assigns a list of `ClassKeywordModel` instances to the `keywords` attribute of `class_attributes`, enabling the dynamic assignment of keywords to a class model. Additionally, there is a commented-out `add_attribute` method, which suggests future functionality for adding attributes to the class model, indicating potential expansion of the builder's capabilities. The implementation employs straightforward list manipulation, where the `set_keywords` method directly assigns the provided list to the class model's keywords. The design pattern used is a fluent interface, as evidenced by the method returning `self` to support method chaining, which enhances usability by allowing multiple method calls in a single statement. The technical stack is minimal, relying solely on Python's built-in features, such as type hinting for clarity and future-proofing, without any external libraries. In the context of a larger system, this code likely functions as a utility within a model-building framework, interacting with other components that define or utilize class models, such as parsers, serializers, or code generators. This integration facilitates seamless interaction with other parts of the system that require dynamic class model manipulation, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and flexibility of the model-building process.",
