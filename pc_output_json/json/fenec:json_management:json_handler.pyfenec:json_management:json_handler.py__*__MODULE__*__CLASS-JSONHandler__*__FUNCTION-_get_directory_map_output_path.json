    "summary": "The code snippet is a method within the `JSONHandler` class, which is integral to a larger system designed for managing the serialization and storage of parsed code models into JSON format. The primary purpose of the `_get_directory_map_output_path` method is to construct a standardized file path for a directory map JSON file, ensuring consistent and platform-independent path generation within the specified output directory. This method is crucial for maintaining organized storage of directory mappings, which are essential for tracking visited directories and their associated Python files, thereby supporting efficient data management and retrieval processes.\n\nKey components of this method include the use of the `Path` class from Python's `pathlib` module, which facilitates the construction of file paths in an object-oriented manner. The method takes a single argument, `directory_output_name`, representing the desired name of the output file, and concatenates it with the `output_directory` attribute of the `JSONHandler` instance to produce the full path. This approach enhances code readability and maintainability by abstracting away platform-specific path separators and providing a clear, concise method for path construction.\n\nThe implementation of the `JSONHandler` class employs a structured approach to directory and file management, leveraging the `pathlib` module for path manipulations and the `shutil` module's `rmtree` function for directory cleanup. The class is designed with a modular architecture, encapsulating specific functionalities within methods such as `save_model_as_json`, `save_visited_directories`, and several private methods like `_create_output_directory`, `_get_json_output_path`, and `_write_json_file`. These methods collectively handle tasks related to JSON file management, including directory creation, path management, and file writing operations.\n\nThe technical stack primarily consists of Python's standard library modules, including `pathlib` for handling filesystem paths and `shutil` for directory operations. Additionally, a custom `logging_decorator` is used to log operations, providing transparency and traceability for actions such as saving models and directories. This logging mechanism is integral to the system's robustness, ensuring that all file management activities are recorded for debugging and auditing purposes.\n\nIn the context of the larger project, the `JSONHandler` class plays a vital role in the file management subsystem, interfacing with other components responsible for parsing and analyzing code models. By standardizing the storage and retrieval of JSON files, it facilitates seamless integration with data processing pipelines and enhances the overall efficiency of the system. The `_get_directory_map_output_path` method, in particular, ensures that directory mappings are consistently stored, enabling reliable tracking and management of code components across the application. This consistency is crucial for the system's ability to manage complex data structures and support various operations related to code analysis and transformation.",
