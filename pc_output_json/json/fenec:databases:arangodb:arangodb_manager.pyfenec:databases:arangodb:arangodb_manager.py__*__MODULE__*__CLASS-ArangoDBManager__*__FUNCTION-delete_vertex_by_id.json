    "summary": "This code defines a method `delete_vertex_by_id` within a class, designed to remove a vertex from a graph database using its unique key, with an optional parameter to specify the graph's name. The primary purpose of this function is to enable dynamic and efficient management of graph data structures, which is essential for applications that require frequent updates, such as social networks, recommendation systems, or any system relying on graph-based data models. Key components of this implementation include the `delete_vertex_by_id` method itself, which takes `vertex_key` and an optional `graph_name` as arguments; the `_get_collection_name_from_id` function, which is responsible for determining the appropriate collection name from the vertex key; and the `db_connector` object, which acts as the interface to the graph database, facilitating the execution of graph-specific operations.\n\nThe implementation begins by determining the collection name associated with the vertex key using the helper function `_get_collection_name_from_id`. If the `graph_name` is not provided, it defaults to a predefined graph name stored in `self.default_graph_name`. The method then accesses the vertex collection within the specified graph using the `db_connector` to perform the deletion operation. A try-except block is employed for error handling, designed to catch and manage exceptions that may occur during the deletion process, thereby ensuring robustness and reliability of the operation.\n\nThe technical stack likely involves a graph database system such as ArangoDB or Neo4j, given the use of graph-specific operations like `graph` and `vertex_collection`. The `db_connector` is a critical component, likely encapsulating the database connection and providing methods to interact with the graph database. This method is part of a larger graph management module within the system, interacting with the database connector to modify graph data. It plays a vital role in applications that require real-time graph updates, enabling functionalities such as user account deletions in social networks or the removal of obsolete nodes in recommendation systems. The modular design of this function allows it to be easily integrated into larger systems, providing a reusable and efficient solution for vertex management in graph databases. This integration ensures that the system can maintain data integrity and consistency while supporting complex operations and interactions within the graph database.",
