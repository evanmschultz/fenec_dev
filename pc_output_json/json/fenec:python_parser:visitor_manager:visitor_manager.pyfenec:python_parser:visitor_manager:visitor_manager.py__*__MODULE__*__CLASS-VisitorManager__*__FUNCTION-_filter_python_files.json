    "summary": "This code defines a utility function `_filter_python_files` within a class, designed to filter a list of filenames, retaining only those that correspond to Python source files. The primary purpose of this function is to streamline the identification of Python files from a given list, which is essential in scenarios where operations need to be performed specifically on Python scripts, such as code analysis, compilation, or execution. Key components include the `_filter_python_files` method, which employs a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and apply a conditional check using the `endswith` method to determine if each file ends with the \".py\" extension, thus identifying it as a Python file. The implementation leverages Python's built-in string method `endswith` within a list comprehension, showcasing a concise and idiomatic approach to list processing in Python. This method efficiently filters the list by iterating over each element and applying a simple string operation, which is both time-efficient and easy to understand, adhering to Python's philosophy of simplicity and readability.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, relying solely on Python's standard library capabilities, specifically list comprehensions and string methods, to achieve its functionality. This approach ensures that the function is lightweight and does not introduce any external dependencies, making it easy to integrate into various Python projects. In the context of a larger system, this function could be part of a file management or code processing module, interacting with components responsible for file I/O operations, code parsing, or project management tasks. It ensures that only relevant Python files are processed further, which could be crucial in systems that perform batch processing of scripts, automated testing, or dynamic code loading. By isolating Python files, this utility function aids in maintaining the efficiency and accuracy of operations that are specific to Python code, thereby fitting seamlessly into a larger codebase that handles diverse file types and operations.",
