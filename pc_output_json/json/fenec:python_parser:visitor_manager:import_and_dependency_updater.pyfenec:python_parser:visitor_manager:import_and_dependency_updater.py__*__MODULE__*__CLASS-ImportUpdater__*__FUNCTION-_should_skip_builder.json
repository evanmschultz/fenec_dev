    "summary": "This code defines a utility function `_should_skip_builder` within a module management system, designed to determine whether a specific `ModuleModelBuilder` instance should be bypassed during a processing routine. The function's primary purpose is to evaluate conditions based on the attributes of two `ModuleModelBuilder` instances and an `ImportModel` object, returning a boolean value that indicates whether the builder should be skipped. Key components include the `_should_skip_builder` function, which takes parameters such as `builder`, `external_builder`, `import_path`, and `import_model`. The function checks three specific conditions: it compares the identifiers of `external_builder` and `builder` to see if they match, verifies if the `import_path` is not a substring of the `external_builder`'s identifier, and checks if the `import_model` has a non-null `local_module_id`. If any of these conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`, indicating that the builder should be skipped.\n\nThe implementation leverages straightforward conditional logic to efficiently determine the necessity of skipping a builder, ensuring that the system avoids redundant operations and optimizes the workflow. The function likely operates within a larger framework for module building and import management, possibly utilizing Python's standard libraries for object handling and comparison. The technical stack is not explicitly detailed in the code snippet, but it suggests a custom framework that manages module dependencies and import paths, potentially integrating with Python's introspection capabilities to handle module identifiers and paths.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this function plays a critical role in module management or dependency resolution processes. It ensures that certain builders are excluded based on specific criteria, thereby optimizing the workflow and preventing redundant operations. This function likely interacts with other components responsible for module loading, dependency checking, and import path management, contributing to a streamlined and efficient module processing pipeline. Its design supports scalability and maintainability within the system, allowing for flexible adaptation to various module management scenarios.",
