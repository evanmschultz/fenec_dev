    "summary": "This code defines a utility method `_get_directory_name` within a class, designed to extract and return the name of a directory from a given path string. The primary purpose of this method is to facilitate file system navigation and management by simplifying the retrieval of directory names, which is crucial for organizing and processing files in larger applications. The key component of this implementation is the `_get_directory_name` method itself, which accepts a single parameter `directory_path` of type `str` and returns the directory's name as a `str`. The method utilizes the `Path` class from Python's `pathlib` module, specifically leveraging the `name` attribute to efficiently extract the directory name from the path. This approach provides a clean and object-oriented way to handle filesystem paths, abstracting the complexity of path manipulations.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, relying solely on Python's standard library, particularly the `pathlib` module. This module is integral to the implementation as it offers a robust and intuitive interface for filesystem path operations, enhancing code readability and maintainability. In the context of a larger system, this method could be part of a file management or data processing application, where it interacts with other components that require directory name extraction for tasks such as organizing files, logging, or generating reports. Its utility lies in abstracting the intricacies of path handling, thereby streamlining the development process and reducing potential errors associated with manual string manipulations. This method fits into the grander scheme by serving as a foundational utility in a codebase that deals with extensive file and directory operations, contributing to the overall efficiency and reliability of the system.",
