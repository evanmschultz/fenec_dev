    "summary": "This code is designed to automate the updating of import statements for a collection of module model builders, thereby enhancing dependency management within a software project. Its primary purpose is to ensure that all necessary imports are correctly tracked and updated, even if they are defined outside the module from which they are imported. This reduces the risk of import-related errors and maintains the integrity of the project's modular structure. The main function, `update_imports`, serves as the entry point for this process. It iterates over a tuple of model builders, creating an `ImportUpdater` instance for each builder to handle and update its import statements. Key components include the `update_imports` method, which orchestrates the import update process, and the `ImportUpdater` class, which encapsulates the logic for processing each model builder's imports. The implementation involves a loop that iterates through the `model_builder_tuple`, instantiating an `ImportUpdater` object for each model builder, and invoking its `process_builder` method to perform the import updates. This method likely employs a strategy pattern to handle different types of import statements, ensuring flexibility and extensibility in managing various import scenarios.\n\nThe technical stack, while not explicitly detailed in the code snippet, likely involves standard Python libraries such as `importlib` for dynamic import handling and possibly custom modules for managing model builders. The code may also utilize reflection or introspection techniques to dynamically analyze and update import statements. In the context of a larger system, this code plays a crucial role in maintaining and organizing module dependencies, particularly in projects with complex inter-module relationships. It ensures that the software project remains modular and maintainable by automating the tedious task of import management. This functionality is essential in large-scale software systems where manual import management can lead to errors and inconsistencies. By integrating seamlessly with the existing codebase, this code supports the overall architecture by providing a reliable mechanism for dependency management, thereby facilitating smoother development workflows and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors due to missing or incorrect imports. This automation is particularly significant in environments where modules are frequently updated or refactored, ensuring that the system remains robust and adaptable to changes.",
