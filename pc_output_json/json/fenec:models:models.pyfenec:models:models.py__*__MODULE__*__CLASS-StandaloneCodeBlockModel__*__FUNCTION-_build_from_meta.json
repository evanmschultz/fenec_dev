    "summary": "This code defines a class method `_build_from_meta` within the `StandaloneCodeBlockModel` class, designed to facilitate the instantiation of this model using a metadata dictionary. The primary purpose of this method is to streamline the creation of a `StandaloneCodeBlockModel` object by extracting, validating, and integrating necessary attributes from the provided metadata, ensuring the metadata is well-structured and complete. This method is significant as it provides a standardized way to construct model instances, enhancing consistency and reliability in the model-building process.\n\nKey components include the `StandaloneCodeBlockModel` class, which serves as the main object being instantiated; `StandaloneCodeBlockSpecificAttributes` and `BaseCodeBlockModel`, which are auxiliary classes responsible for parsing specific and base attributes from the metadata, respectively. The implementation involves a series of validation checks to confirm that the input is a dictionary and contains all required keys with valid values. It utilizes helper methods `_build_from_meta` and `_build_from_metadata` from the `StandaloneCodeBlockSpecificAttributes` and `BaseCodeBlockModel` classes to parse the metadata. The results from these methods are combined using dictionary unpacking to instantiate the `StandaloneCodeBlockModel`. Error handling is robust, with specific `ValueError` exceptions raised for common issues like incorrect data types or missing keys, and a generic `Exception` for unexpected errors.\n\nThe technical stack primarily involves Python's standard library, leveraging its capabilities for data handling, type checking, and exception management. The method's design reflects a common pattern in object-oriented programming where class methods are used to provide alternative constructors, enhancing flexibility and modularity in object creation. In the context of a larger system, this method is integral to a model-building process, interacting with other components that define specific and base attributes for code blocks. It ensures that the constructed model is comprehensive, adheres to expected standards, and is ready for further processing or integration within the system. This method likely plays a crucial role in a larger framework or application where code block models are dynamically generated and utilized, possibly in environments that require modular and reusable code structures, such as code editors, compilers, or development environments. By ensuring that each model is built with validated and complete metadata, the method supports the system's overall robustness and adaptability, facilitating seamless integration and interaction with other system components.",
