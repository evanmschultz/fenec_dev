    "summary": "This code snippet is a crucial component of a type-checking mechanism within a Python project, designed to enhance code quality and maintainability by ensuring type correctness during development. Its primary purpose is to conditionally import the `ClassKeywordModel` and `DecoratorModel` from the `fenec.models.models` module when type checking is enabled, thereby providing necessary type information without impacting runtime performance. Key components include the `TYPE_CHECKING` constant from Python's `typing` module, which determines whether these imports should be executed solely for type-checking purposes. This approach leverages Python's conditional import feature, allowing the inclusion of type hints without incurring the overhead of importing modules during execution, thus optimizing performance while maintaining type safety.\n\nThe implementation utilizes Python's standard library, particularly the `typing` module, to support type hints and type checking. This ensures that the code remains efficient by avoiding unnecessary imports during runtime, while still providing comprehensive type information for development tools. The technical stack is primarily based on Python's built-in capabilities, with the `fenec` package providing custom models and utilities that integrate with this type-checking mechanism. The `fenec.models.models` module is a crucial part of the system, offering structured representations of Python classes, which are essential for the type-checking process.\n\nIn the context of the larger project, this code snippet is integral to a codebase that emphasizes type safety and modular design, facilitating the development of robust and error-free applications. It interacts with other components by supplying type information for models, which can be utilized by integrated development environments (IDEs) and type checkers to validate code correctness and assist developers with code completion and error detection. This snippet is particularly relevant to the `ClassModelBuilder`, a specialized builder class that constructs a model representation of a Python class. The `ClassModelBuilder` relies on the type information provided by this snippet to accurately encapsulate class details such as decorators and keywords, ensuring that the constructed models are both comprehensive and type-safe. This integration highlights the snippet's role in supporting a larger system that employs object-oriented design principles and a builder pattern to create structured and maintainable code representations.",
