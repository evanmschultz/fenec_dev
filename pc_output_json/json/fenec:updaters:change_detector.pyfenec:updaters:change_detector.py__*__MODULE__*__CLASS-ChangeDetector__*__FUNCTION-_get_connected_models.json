    "summary": "This code defines a method `_get_connected_models` within a class, designed to retrieve a set of model IDs that are connected to a specified model within a graph database, specifically ArangoDB. The primary purpose of this method is to facilitate comprehensive dependency analysis by identifying and returning all models that are either directly dependent on or are dependencies of a given model. It includes an optional parameter, `both_directions`, to include connections in both directions, thereby enhancing the scope of the analysis. Key components include: the `arangodb_manager` object, which acts as an interface to the ArangoDB database, enabling the execution of graph queries; the `get_outbound_models` method, which retrieves models that the specified model depends on or has as children, effectively capturing the outbound edges in the graph; and the `get_inbound_models` method, which, when `both_directions` is set to `True`, retrieves models that depend on or are parents of the specified model, capturing the inbound edges.\n\nThe implementation leverages ArangoDB's graph processing capabilities to manage and query graph data efficiently. It uses list comprehensions to extract model IDs from the query results and updates a set to ensure the uniqueness of the connected model IDs. This approach allows the method to handle both directed and undirected graph traversals, depending on the `both_directions` flag. The technical stack primarily involves ArangoDB, a multi-model database known for its robust graph processing capabilities, which is crucial for managing complex relationships and dependencies in data models.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this method is likely part of a data management or dependency tracking module, which is essential for analyzing model relationships and dependencies within a graph-based data structure. It interacts with other components responsible for managing database connections and model metadata, providing a utility for dependency resolution and impact analysis. This functionality is critical in systems where understanding the interdependencies between models can inform decision-making processes, such as in software configuration management, data lineage tracking, or impact analysis in complex systems. The method's design supports scalability and flexibility, allowing it to be integrated into larger workflows that require dynamic dependency analysis and model management. This integration ensures that the system can adapt to evolving data structures and maintain accurate dependency mappings, which are vital for maintaining system integrity and facilitating informed decision-making.",
