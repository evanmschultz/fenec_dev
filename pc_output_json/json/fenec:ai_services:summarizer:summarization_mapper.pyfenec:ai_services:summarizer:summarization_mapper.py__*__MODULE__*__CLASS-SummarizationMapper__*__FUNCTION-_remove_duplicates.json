    "summary": "This code defines a method `_remove_duplicates` within a class, aimed at efficiently removing duplicate entries from a list of models while preserving their original order. The primary functionality of this method is to process a list, referred to as `summarization_map`, which contains elements of a generic type `ModelType`, and return a new list with duplicates removed based on a unique identifier, `id`, associated with each model. Key components include the use of a set, `summary_ids`, to track unique identifiers efficiently, and a list, `unique_summary_map`, to store models without duplicates. The implementation iterates over the `summarization_map`, checking if each model's `id` is already present in the `summary_ids` set. If the `id` is not found, the model is appended to `unique_summary_map`, and its `id` is added to `summary_ids`, ensuring that only the first occurrence of each model is retained. This approach leverages the O(1) average time complexity of set operations for checking membership and adding elements, making the method efficient for processing large lists.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, utilizing Python's built-in data structures such as lists and sets to achieve the desired functionality. This choice ensures simplicity and performance without the need for external libraries. The method is type-annotated, using Python's type hinting system to specify that `summarization_map` is a list of `ModelType` objects, indicating that `ModelType` is a generic type or a class defined elsewhere in the codebase.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this method is likely part of a data processing or management module where maintaining unique entries is crucial. It could interact with other components that generate or utilize model summaries, such as data ingestion pipelines, reporting tools, or user interfaces that display model information. By ensuring that each model is represented only once, this method helps maintain data integrity and consistency across the system. Its role in the larger codebase might involve integration with database operations, where unique constraints are necessary, or with APIs that require deduplicated data for efficient processing and transmission. This method contributes to the overall robustness and reliability of the system by preventing data redundancy and ensuring that operations dependent on unique model entries function correctly.",
