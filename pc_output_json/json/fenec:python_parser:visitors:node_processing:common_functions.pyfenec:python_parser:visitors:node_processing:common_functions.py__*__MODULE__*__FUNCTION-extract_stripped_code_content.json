    "summary": "This code defines a utility function, `extract_stripped_code_content`, which is integral to processing Python code represented as Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) nodes. Its primary purpose is to extract the raw code content from a given CST node and enhance its usability by removing any leading or trailing whitespace, thereby producing a clean and standardized code snippet. This function is significant in scenarios where precise code analysis or transformation is required, as it ensures that the extracted code is in a format suitable for further processing.\n\nKey components of this implementation include the function `extract_stripped_code_content`, which takes a `libcst.CSTNode` as an input parameter. It utilizes the `extract_code_content` function to retrieve the initial code content from the CST node and then applies Python's built-in `strip()` method to remove unnecessary whitespace from both ends of the string. This approach ensures that the output is a clean and consistent representation of the code, ready for subsequent analysis or transformation tasks.\n\nThe technical stack prominently features the `libcst` library, which is essential for parsing and manipulating Python code as CST nodes. `libcst` provides a robust framework for handling Python's syntax tree, allowing for precise code analysis and transformation while maintaining the original code structure's fidelity. This capability is crucial for accurate code manipulation, making `libcst` a vital component of the system.\n\nIn the context of a larger code analysis or transformation system, this function serves as a utility to clean and prepare code snippets extracted from CST nodes. It is likely part of a comprehensive suite of tools designed to handle CST node parsing and manipulation, ensuring that the extracted code is in a standardized format for subsequent operations. This function interacts with other components that may perform tasks such as code linting, formatting, or refactoring, ensuring that the code snippets are ready for these processes by providing a clean and consistent input. By integrating with a system that processes and analyzes Python code, this function contributes to the overall goal of maintaining code quality and facilitating automated code transformations, thereby enhancing the system's ability to perform accurate and efficient code analysis and modifications.",
