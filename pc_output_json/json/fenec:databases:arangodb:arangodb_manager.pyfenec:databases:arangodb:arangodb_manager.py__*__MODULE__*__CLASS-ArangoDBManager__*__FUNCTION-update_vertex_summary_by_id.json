    "summary": "This code is designed to update the summary attribute of a vertex within a graph database, ensuring that the vertex data remains current and accurate. The primary function, `update_vertex_summary_by_id`, is responsible for retrieving and updating the vertex data by its unique identifier. It takes two arguments: the vertex's ID and the new summary to be set. Key components include the `update_vertex_summary_by_id` function, which orchestrates the retrieval and update process; `_get_collection_name_from_id`, a helper function that determines the appropriate collection name based on the vertex ID; and `db_connector`, an object that facilitates interaction with the database.\n\nThe implementation begins by determining the collection name using the vertex ID through the `_get_collection_name_from_id` function. It then accesses the corresponding collection using the `db_connector`, which is likely an interface to a graph database such as ArangoDB. The code retrieves the vertex data using the `get` method of the `StandardCollection` class. If the vertex data is successfully retrieved and is in a mutable dictionary format, the function updates the vertex's summary field with the new summary provided. The code includes error handling to manage scenarios where the vertex data is not in a mutable format, logging an error message in such cases.\n\nThe technical stack includes a database connector, which interfaces with a graph database, and utilizes logging for error reporting. The use of type hints such as `Result[Json | None]` suggests a modern Python environment with type checking, possibly leveraging libraries like `typing` for enhanced code clarity and maintainability. In the context of a larger system, this function is part of a data management module that interacts with a graph database to maintain and update vertex information. It supports applications that rely on up-to-date graph data for operations such as search, analysis, or visualization, ensuring data integrity and consistency across the system. This function likely interacts with other components responsible for data retrieval, processing, and visualization, forming a crucial part of the data lifecycle management within the system.",
