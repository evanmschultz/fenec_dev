    "summary": "The code defines a method `_create_prompt` within a class, which is integral to a system designed for generating detailed and context-aware code summaries using OpenAI's language models. The primary purpose of this method is to construct a structured prompt that incorporates various contextual elements, such as summaries of child elements, dependencies, import details, and parent elements, to facilitate a multi-pass summarization process. This approach enhances the depth and accuracy of the generated summaries by iteratively refining them with each pass. Key components include the `_create_prompt` method itself and the `SummarizationPromptCreator` class, which encapsulates the logic for generating the prompt. The method operates by invoking the `create_prompt` method of the `SummarizationPromptCreator` class, passing in several parameters that provide context for the summarization process, such as the code to be summarized, summaries of related elements, and the current pass number. If the prompt creation is successful, the method returns the generated prompt; otherwise, it raises an exception to indicate failure, ensuring robust error handling.\n\nThe implementation leverages Python's type hinting for parameter and return types, which enhances code clarity and type safety. The `SummarizationPromptCreator` class is designed to encapsulate the prompt creation logic, promoting modularity and reusability within the system. The method is structured to handle potential failures gracefully by raising exceptions, which can be managed by higher-level components, ensuring the system's resilience. The technical stack is primarily based on Python, utilizing custom classes to encapsulate the prompt creation logic.\n\nIn the context of the larger project, this method functions as a utility within the `OpenAISummarizer` class, which is responsible for generating code summaries by interfacing with OpenAI's API. The class supports a multi-pass summarization approach, allowing for iterative refinement of summaries by considering various contextual inputs. The `_create_prompt` method interacts with other components of the `OpenAISummarizer` class, such as methods for constructing system and user messages, compiling message lists for chat completion, and retrieving summaries from the OpenAI API. This integration enables the system to effectively leverage OpenAI's language models, providing detailed and contextually rich code summaries. The method's role in the larger system is crucial for ensuring that the prompts sent to the OpenAI API are well-structured and contextually enriched, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated summaries.",
