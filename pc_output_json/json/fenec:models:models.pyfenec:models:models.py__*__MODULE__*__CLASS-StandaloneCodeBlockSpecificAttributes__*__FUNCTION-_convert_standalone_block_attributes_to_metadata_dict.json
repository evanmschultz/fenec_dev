    "summary": "This code is part of a larger system designed to transform code block attributes into a structured metadata format compatible with ChromaDB, a database optimized for metadata management. The primary function, `_convert_standalone_block_attributes_to_metadata_dict`, is responsible for converting attributes of standalone code blocks into a dictionary format that ChromaDB can efficiently store and query. This function returns a dictionary with a single key, \"variable_assignments\", which is linked to the output of another method, `_convert_variable_assignments_to_metadata`. Although the implementation of this auxiliary method is not provided, it is inferred to process and organize variable assignments into a format suitable for metadata storage, ensuring that the data is structured correctly for ChromaDB's requirements.\n\nThe implementation of `_convert_standalone_block_attributes_to_metadata_dict` is straightforward, focusing on data transformation by utilizing Python's dictionary data structure to map processed variable assignments to a metadata key. This design reflects a separation of concerns, where the conversion of variable assignments is delegated to a dedicated method, promoting modularity and reusability within the codebase. The use of type hints such as `dict[str, str | int]` indicates adherence to Python's type hinting system, enhancing code readability and maintainability.\n\nThe technical stack is not explicitly detailed in the snippet, but the function's design suggests it is part of a custom-built system where ChromaDB is employed for metadata management. The absence of external libraries or frameworks in the snippet implies that the function is a component of a larger system, potentially involving custom logic for handling metadata.\n\nIn the broader context, this function likely serves as a preparatory step in a data processing pipeline, interfacing with other components responsible for handling code block attributes and variable assignments. Its role is crucial in ensuring that data is formatted correctly for storage or retrieval operations within ChromaDB, thereby facilitating efficient metadata management and query execution. This function may interact with other modules that perform data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, contributing to the overall functionality of a system that manages and queries metadata in a structured and efficient manner. By ensuring that variable assignments are correctly converted into metadata, this function supports the system's ability to handle complex queries and data retrieval tasks, enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the metadata management process.",
