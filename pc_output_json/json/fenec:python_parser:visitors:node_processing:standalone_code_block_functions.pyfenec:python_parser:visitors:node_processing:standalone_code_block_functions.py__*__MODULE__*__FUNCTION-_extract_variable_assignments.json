    "summary": "This code is a specialized function within a system designed for abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, specifically focusing on the extraction of variable assignment statements from a `libcst.SimpleStatementLine` node. The primary purpose of the `_extract_variable_assignments` function is to identify and retrieve the code content of variable assignments within a specific line of Python code. This functionality is crucial for subsequent analysis, transformation, or refactoring tasks within the larger codebase, enabling precise modifications and optimizations. Key components include the `_extract_variable_assignments` function itself, which iterates over the `body` attribute of a `SimpleStatementLine` node to detect instances of `libcst.AnnAssign` and `libcst.Assign`, representing annotated and regular assignment statements, respectively. The function utilizes `common_functions.extract_stripped_code_content` to obtain a clean, stripped string representation of each assignment statement, ensuring that the extracted code is devoid of extraneous whitespace or formatting issues.\n\nThe implementation employs a straightforward iteration and type-checking approach, leveraging Python's `isinstance` function to efficiently filter and process relevant nodes. This ensures that only assignment statements are extracted, maintaining the integrity and focus of the analysis. The technical stack prominently features the `libcst` library, which provides a concrete syntax tree for Python, allowing for precise and reliable code analysis and transformation. Additionally, the code relies on a custom utility function from `common_functions` to handle the extraction of code content, highlighting a modular approach where specific tasks are delegated to specialized functions.\n\nIn the context of a larger code analysis or refactoring tool, this function plays an integral role in parsing and understanding variable assignments. It potentially interacts with other components that perform code modifications, linting, or static analysis, serving as a foundational step in the pipeline that prepares code for further processing. By isolating and extracting variable assignments, this function enables subsequent operations to focus on specific code elements, enhancing the tool's ability to perform targeted transformations or analyses. This modular design supports scalability and flexibility, allowing the system to adapt to various codebases and analysis requirements, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and effective code management process.",
