    "summary": "This code is a method within a system designed to transform a standalone code block model into a metadata dictionary format suitable for integration with ChromaDB, a database optimized for structured data management. The primary purpose of the `convert_to_metadata` method is to aggregate metadata by merging two distinct dictionaries: one containing base attributes and another containing standalone block attributes. This merging is efficiently achieved using Python's dictionary unpacking feature, which combines the outputs of two helper methods: `_convert_base_attributes_to_metadata_dict` and `_convert_standalone_block_attributes_to_metadata_dict`. These helper methods, likely defined elsewhere in the class, are responsible for extracting and formatting the relevant attributes into dictionary form, ensuring that the metadata is comprehensive and correctly structured.\n\nThe implementation leverages Python's type hinting to enhance code clarity and correctness, specifying that the method returns a dictionary with string keys and values that can be either strings or integers. This use of type annotations not only improves readability but also aids in maintaining the code by providing clear expectations for the function's output. The technical stack is minimal, relying solely on Python's built-in dictionary operations and type annotations, which highlights the method's simplicity and efficiency.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this method plays a critical role in preparing data for storage or retrieval in ChromaDB. It interfaces with other components responsible for data transformation and storage operations, ensuring that the metadata is correctly formatted and seamlessly integrated into the database. This method is likely part of a broader data processing pipeline, acting as a bridge between raw data representation and structured database storage. Its design emphasizes modularity and reusability, allowing it to be easily adapted or extended for different data models or database systems within the larger project. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining a flexible and scalable data management system, facilitating efficient data handling and retrieval across various applications.",
