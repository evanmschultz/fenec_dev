    "summary": "This code defines a class method `_build_from_metadata` within a class likely named `DependencyModel`, designed to construct an instance of `DependencyModel` from a provided metadata dictionary. The primary purpose of this method is to streamline the creation of `DependencyModel` objects by extracting necessary information from metadata, specifically the `code_block_id`. Key components include the `_build_from_metadata` class method, which performs input validation to ensure the metadata is a dictionary and extracts the `code_block_id` to initialize the `DependencyModel`. The implementation involves a straightforward validation check using Python's `isinstance` function to confirm the input type, followed by the instantiation of the class using the `code_block_id` key from the metadata. The method includes rudimentary error handling for type validation, although it contains misplaced `raise` statements that suggest incomplete exception handling logic. The technical stack is minimal, utilizing Python's built-in data structures and exception handling mechanisms. In the context of a larger system, this method likely functions as a utility for constructing dependency models from metadata, potentially interacting with other components that manage or utilize metadata for code blocks. This could be part of a dependency management or code analysis system, where metadata-driven instantiation of models is crucial for tracking and analyzing code dependencies efficiently.",
