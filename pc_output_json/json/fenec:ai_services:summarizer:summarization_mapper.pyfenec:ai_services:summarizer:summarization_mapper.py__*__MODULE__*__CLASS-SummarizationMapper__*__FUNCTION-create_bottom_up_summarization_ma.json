    "summary": "This code is designed to generate a bottom-up summarization map, which is essential for organizing models based on their hierarchical dependencies, starting from the lowest-level models and progressing to higher-level ones. The primary function, `create_bottom_up_summarization_map`, orchestrates the creation of this map by managing the traversal and organization of models, ensuring that all dependencies are accurately captured. Key components include: the `create_bottom_up_summarization_map` method, which initiates the process by refreshing the list of models to be updated and then iteratively processes each model to build the summarization map; `_refresh_models_to_update`, a helper function that updates the list of models to be processed, ensuring the map reflects the most current model states; `_set_inbound_models_in_summarization_map` and `_set_outbound_models_in_summarization_map`, which manage the inclusion of models based on their inbound and outbound relationships, respectively, ensuring that all relevant dependencies are captured; and `_remove_duplicates`, which ensures the final map is free of duplicate entries, maintaining the integrity of the summarization map.\n\nThe implementation involves iterating over models, updating a temporary map with inbound and outbound models, and appending these to the main summarization map. This process is repeated for each model, ensuring that all dependencies are captured. Duplicates are removed before reversing the list to achieve a bottom-up order, which is essential for accurately representing the hierarchical structure. The use of a temporary map (`self.temp_map`) allows for efficient management of model relationships during the traversal process. The method concludes by logging the successful creation of the summarization map, indicating the use of Python's standard logging library for tracking the process.\n\nThe technical stack primarily involves Python, with a reliance on its standard logging library for process tracking. The method likely interacts with a database or model repository to update and retrieve model information, ensuring that the summarization map accurately reflects the current state of model relationships. In the context of a larger system, this method plays a significant role in dependency management or model organization, interfacing with other components to maintain an up-to-date and accurate representation of model hierarchies. This functionality is critical for systems that require a clear understanding of model dependencies, such as those involved in complex data processing pipelines or modular software architectures. By providing a structured view of model dependencies, this code supports efficient model management and integration within larger systems, facilitating tasks such as impact analysis, change management, and system optimization.",
