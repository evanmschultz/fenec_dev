    "summary": "This code defines a method `_get_collection_name_from_id` within a class, designed to determine the collection name associated with a given block ID. The primary purpose of this function is to parse a block ID string, which is expected to be formatted with components separated by `__*__`, and identify the type of block it represents, subsequently mapping it to a corresponding collection name. Key components include a dictionary `block_type_functions` that maps block type identifiers to lambda functions returning collection names, and a loop that iterates over this dictionary to match the block type part of the ID with a predefined key. The implementation involves splitting the block ID into parts using Python's built-in `split` method, extracting the last part to identify the block type, and using a dictionary of lambda functions to return the appropriate collection name based on this type. If no match is found, it defaults to returning \"unknown\". The technical stack is minimal, relying solely on Python's built-in string manipulation and dictionary functionalities, specifically leveraging Python's type hinting for clarity and maintainability. In the context of a larger system, this function likely serves as a utility within a data management or organization module, facilitating the categorization of different code blocks or components based on their identifiers. It potentially interacts with other components that manage or store these collections, such as a database or a file system, by providing a standardized way to categorize and retrieve collections based on block identifiers. This method enhances the modularity and scalability of the system by allowing easy addition of new block types and corresponding collections without altering the core logic. This utility function is crucial for maintaining an organized structure within the system, ensuring that each block is correctly categorized and easily retrievable, thereby supporting efficient data management and retrieval processes.",
