    "summary": "The `_clean_output_directory` method is a crucial part of the `JSONHandler` class, designed to manage the serialization and storage of parsed code models into JSON format. Its primary function is to ensure that the specified output directory, indicated by `self.output_directory`, is completely removed along with all its contents. This operation is essential for maintaining a clean state for subsequent data storage operations, preventing data clutter, and ensuring that outdated or unnecessary files do not persist. This is particularly important in environments where storage efficiency and data integrity are priorities.\n\nKey components of this method include the use of the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module, which provides an object-oriented interface for file system path manipulations, and the `rmtree` function from the `shutil` module, which is employed to recursively delete the directory and its contents. The method first checks if the directory exists and is indeed a directory before proceeding with the deletion, ensuring that the operation is both safe and intentional.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward yet effective, leveraging Python's standard library to perform high-level file operations. The `Path` class is used to create a `Path` object representing the output directory, and the `exists` and `is_dir` methods are called to verify the directory's existence and type. If these conditions are met, `rmtree` is invoked to perform the recursive deletion.\n\nThe technical stack primarily involves Python's standard library modules: `pathlib` for path manipulations, providing a more intuitive and readable approach to handling file system paths, and `shutil` for high-level file operations, specifically for directory removal in this context. Additionally, the `JSONHandler` class utilizes a custom `logging_decorator` to log operations, which aids in tracking and debugging the file management processes.\n\nIn the context of the larger project, the `_clean_output_directory` method is a critical component of the `JSONHandler` class, which is responsible for converting various code components into structured JSON files. This method ensures that the output directory is prepared for new data by removing any existing files, thus supporting the class's functionality of organized storage and cleanup. The `JSONHandler` class interacts with other components by providing a clean slate for storing serialized data, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and organization of the project's data management system. This method, along with others in the class, supports a modular and efficient approach to handling JSON file management, contributing to the overall robustness and maintainability of the system.",
