    "summary": "The `NodeAndPositionData` class is a specialized data structure designed to encapsulate nodes from a concrete syntax tree (CST) along with their precise positional information within the source code. This class is integral to systems that require detailed analysis and manipulation of source code, such as static analysis tools, code refactoring utilities, or integrated development environments (IDEs). The primary purpose of this class is to provide a structured way to store and access both the hierarchical and positional data of syntax tree nodes, facilitating operations that depend on understanding the exact location and structure of code elements.\n\nKey components of this implementation include the `NodeAndPositionData` class itself, which is defined as a data class using Python's `dataclasses` module. This class contains three attributes: `nodes`, a list of `libcst.CSTNode` objects representing the nodes in the syntax tree; `start`, an integer indicating the starting position of the node in the source code; and `end`, an integer marking the ending position. The use of `dataclasses` allows for automatic generation of utility methods such as `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`, making the class efficient and easy to use for data storage and retrieval without additional boilerplate code.\n\nThe implementation leverages the `dataclasses` module to streamline the creation of the class, ensuring it is lightweight and focused on its primary function of data encapsulation. The `libcst` library is employed to handle the construction and manipulation of concrete syntax trees, providing a robust framework for parsing Python code while preserving formatting details. This combination of `dataclasses` and `libcst` allows for precise code transformations and analyses, which are essential for maintaining code integrity during operations like syntax highlighting, code navigation, and automated refactoring.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, `NodeAndPositionData` plays a crucial role in enabling precise and efficient code analysis and manipulation. It interacts with components that parse source code into syntax trees, perform transformations, or analyze code structure and semantics. This data structure is particularly valuable in tools that require detailed positional information, such as linters, code formatters, or IDEs that offer advanced features like code navigation and refactoring. By encapsulating both the structural and positional data of syntax tree nodes, `NodeAndPositionData` supports the development of sophisticated code analysis and transformation capabilities, contributing to the overall functionality and effectiveness of the system.",
