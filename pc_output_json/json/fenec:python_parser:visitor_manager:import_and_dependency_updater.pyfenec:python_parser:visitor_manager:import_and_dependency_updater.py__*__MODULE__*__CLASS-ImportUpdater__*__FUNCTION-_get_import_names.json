    "summary": "This code snippet is a utility function within a larger system designed for code analysis and management, specifically targeting the extraction of import names from an `ImportModel` object. The primary function, `_get_import_names`, is tasked with returning a list of strings that represent the names of imports contained within the `ImportModel`. Key components include the `_get_import_names` function itself, which utilizes a list comprehension to efficiently iterate over the `import_names` attribute of the `ImportModel`, extracting the `name` attribute from each element. This approach leverages Python's list comprehension for concise and efficient data extraction, ensuring that the function operates with minimal overhead and high readability.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward, relying solely on Python's built-in capabilities, which underscores its simplicity and efficiency. The function is designed to be a utility within a larger codebase, likely interacting with other components that handle parsing or analyzing code. It plays a crucial role in systems that manage or inspect code dependencies and imports, potentially feeding into modules that perform static analysis, dependency resolution, or code refactoring.\n\nIn the context of a larger project, this function could be part of a code analysis toolchain, where it interfaces with parsers that convert source code into abstract representations like the `ImportModel`. It may also interact with components that visualize dependency graphs or generate reports on code structure. The minimalistic design ensures that it can be easily integrated into various stages of code analysis workflows, contributing to a comprehensive system for managing and understanding code dependencies. This function's role is pivotal in maintaining the integrity and clarity of codebases by providing a clear and efficient mechanism for tracking and analyzing import statements, which are fundamental to understanding code structure and dependencies.",
