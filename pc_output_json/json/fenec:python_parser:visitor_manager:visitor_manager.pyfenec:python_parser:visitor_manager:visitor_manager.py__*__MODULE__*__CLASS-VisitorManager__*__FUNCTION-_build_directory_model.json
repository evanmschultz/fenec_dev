    "summary": "This code is part of a sophisticated system designed to model and manage directory structures by encapsulating metadata and hierarchical relationships within a `DirectoryModel` object. Its primary purpose is to construct a detailed representation of a directory, capturing unique identifiers for the directory and its parent, as well as lists of subdirectory and child module identifiers. This functionality is crucial for systems that require structured access to directory information, such as indexing services or user interfaces for browsing directory contents. The key component of this code is the `_build_directory_model` function, which orchestrates the creation of the directory model by invoking several helper methods. These methods include `DirectoryIDGenerationStrategy`, which employs a strategy pattern to generate a unique identifier for the directory, ensuring consistent and collision-free ID generation across the system; `_get_parent_directory_id`, which retrieves the parent directory's ID to facilitate the construction of a hierarchical model; `_get_directory_name`, which extracts the directory's name for inclusion in the model; `_get_subdirectory_ids`, which compiles a list of identifiers for all subdirectories, supporting the hierarchical structure; and `_generate_module_ids`, which generates identifiers for child modules within the directory, aiding in comprehensive metadata encapsulation.\n\nThe implementation leverages a hierarchical data structure to represent the directory and its relationships, allowing for efficient navigation and management of directory metadata. This design is crucial for systems that require structured access to directory information, such as indexing services or user interfaces for browsing directory contents. The technical stack, while not explicitly detailed in the snippet, likely involves Python's standard library for file and directory operations, such as `os` or `pathlib`, alongside custom classes for ID generation and model representation. This code is likely integrated into a larger file management or content organization module, interfacing with other components that require access to structured directory metadata. It may interact with indexing services to facilitate search and retrieval operations or with user interfaces to provide a navigable view of directory contents. The modular and extensible design supports scalability and adaptability within the broader system, ensuring that directory metadata is consistently and accurately represented across various components.",
