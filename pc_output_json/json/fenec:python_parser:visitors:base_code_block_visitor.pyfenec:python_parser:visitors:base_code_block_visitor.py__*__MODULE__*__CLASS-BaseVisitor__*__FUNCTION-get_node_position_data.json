    "summary": "This code is designed to extract and return the positional data of a given Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) node within a Python source code file, specifically focusing on determining the start and end line numbers of the specified CST node. This functionality is crucial for tasks such as code analysis, refactoring, or syntax highlighting, where precise location data is necessary for accurate manipulation or display of code elements. The key component of this implementation is the `get_node_position_data` method, which takes a `libcst.CSTNode` as input and returns a `PositionData` object containing the start and end line numbers. The method utilizes the `get_metadata` function to retrieve metadata from the `WhitespaceInclusivePositionProvider`, which provides a `CodeRange` object encapsulating the start and end positions of the node. If the metadata is of type `CodeRange`, the function extracts the line numbers and constructs a `PositionData` object with these values.\n\nThe implementation employs a straightforward approach, leveraging the `libcst` library's capabilities to handle CST nodes and metadata. The `libcst` library is a powerful tool for parsing and manipulating Python source code, providing a rich set of features for working with CSTs. The `WhitespaceInclusivePositionProvider` is a specific metadata provider within `libcst` that includes whitespace in its position calculations, ensuring accurate line number data. The `PositionData` class is used to encapsulate the start and end line numbers, providing a clear and structured way to return this information.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this function could be part of a code analysis tool or integrated development environment (IDE) feature, interacting with other components that manipulate or display source code. It provides precise location data for various code elements, enabling features such as syntax highlighting, code navigation, and automated refactoring. By integrating with other tools and components within a codebase, this function enhances the ability to perform detailed code analysis and manipulation, contributing to a more robust and feature-rich development environment. This functionality is particularly significant in environments where understanding the exact positioning of code elements is essential for maintaining code quality and facilitating developer productivity.",
