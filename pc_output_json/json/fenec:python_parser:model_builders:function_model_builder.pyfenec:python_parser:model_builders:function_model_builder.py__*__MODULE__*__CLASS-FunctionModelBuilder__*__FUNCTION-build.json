    "summary": "This code defines a method `build` within a class, designed to construct and return an instance of `FunctionModel`. The primary purpose of this method is to assemble a comprehensive function model by first preparing its child models and then integrating specific attributes, which are essential for the model's functionality. Key components include: `build_children`, a method responsible for initializing or configuring child models, ensuring that all necessary sub-components are prepared before the main model is constructed; `set_children_ids`, which assigns unique identifiers to these child models, facilitating their management and traceability within the larger model structure; and `FunctionModel`, a class that encapsulates the constructed model, integrating attributes gathered from `_get_common_attributes` and `_get_function_specific_attributes`, which are likely methods that retrieve shared and specific attributes necessary for the model's operation.\n\nThe implementation employs a decorator `@logging_decorator` with a message parameter to log the process of building the function model, indicating the use of a logging design pattern that enhances traceability and debugging capabilities. This decorator likely wraps the `build` method to automatically log entry, exit, and possibly exceptions, providing insights into the model-building process. The method aggregates attributes using Python's unpacking syntax to merge common and function-specific attributes into the `FunctionModel` instantiation, demonstrating a clean and efficient approach to attribute management.\n\nThe technical stack, while not explicitly detailed in the snippet, involves Python's standard logging practices, object-oriented programming paradigms, and possibly a custom logging framework that supports the `@logging_decorator`. This suggests a robust infrastructure for monitoring and debugging model construction processes. In the context of a larger system, this method likely serves as a critical component of a model-building framework, interacting with other model components and contributing to a modular and extensible architecture for constructing complex models. It fits into a broader codebase by providing a standardized way to build function models, ensuring consistency and reliability across different parts of the system that require model instantiation and configuration. This method's design supports scalability and maintainability, allowing for easy integration and extension as the system evolves.",
