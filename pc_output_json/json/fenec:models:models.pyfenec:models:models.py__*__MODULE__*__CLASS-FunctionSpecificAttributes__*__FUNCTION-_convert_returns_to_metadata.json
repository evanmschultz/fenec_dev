    "summary": "The `_convert_returns_to_metadata` method is a specialized function designed to transform return values into a structured metadata format, which is crucial for data serialization and preparation for subsequent processing stages within a larger data handling system. This method is likely part of a class dedicated to data transformation, possibly within a data processing pipeline or a data management system, where it plays a significant role in ensuring data consistency and integrity. Key components of this method include its integration within a class structure, where it interacts with other methods and attributes to achieve its functionality. The method likely involves iterating over return values, applying specific transformations, and formatting them into a metadata string. This process may utilize algorithms for data parsing and formatting, employing data structures such as dictionaries or lists to organize and manage the metadata efficiently.\n\nThe implementation details, while not explicitly visible in the snippet, suggest the use of standard Python libraries for data manipulation. Libraries such as `json` might be used for serialization tasks, while `pandas` could be employed for handling complex data structures, depending on the broader context of the system. The method's design might follow common design patterns like the Factory or Builder pattern to ensure flexible and scalable metadata generation. These patterns would facilitate the creation of metadata objects in a consistent manner, allowing for easy extension and maintenance of the code.\n\nIn the context of a larger project, this method is likely a component of a data processing pipeline, contributing to the preparation of data for storage, analysis, or transmission. It ensures that return values are consistently formatted as metadata, facilitating seamless integration with other system components responsible for data input, output, or transformation. This method might interact with modules that handle data acquisition, storage, or visualization, ensuring that the metadata is compatible with various stages of the data lifecycle. Its role is significant in maintaining data integrity and consistency across the system, supporting efficient data management and processing workflows. By converting return values into a standardized metadata format, this method enables other components of the system to easily interpret and utilize the data, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and reliability of the data handling system.",
