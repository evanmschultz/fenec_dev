    "summary": "This code is designed to recursively build a summarization map of interconnected models by exploring outbound relationships from a specified model within a database. Its primary function, `_set_outbound_models_in_summarization_map`, is tasked with identifying and recording all models that are directly or indirectly connected to a given model through outbound links. This function takes a model identifier as input and employs a set, `model_visited_in_db`, to track models that have already been processed, thereby preventing redundant operations and infinite recursion. Upon confirming that a model has not been visited, it marks the model as visited and retrieves its outbound models using the `arangodb_manager.get_outbound_models` method. For each retrieved outbound model, the function recursively invokes itself to ensure a thorough traversal of the model network, appending each model to a `temp_map` for summarization purposes. This implementation leverages a recursive depth-first search algorithm to efficiently navigate and map the complex web of model relationships.\n\nThe technical stack prominently features an `arangodb_manager`, which serves as an interface to an ArangoDB database. ArangoDB is a versatile multi-model database that supports graph data structures, making it particularly well-suited for managing and querying intricate relationships between models. The use of ArangoDB indicates that the system is optimized for handling graph-based data, which is essential for applications that require detailed network analysis or dependency mapping.\n\nWithin the broader system, this code functions as a critical component of a data processing or analysis module that necessitates a comprehensive understanding of complex model interconnections. It is likely employed in scenarios such as dependency analysis, network visualization, or impact assessment within a larger data management or analytics platform. By recursively capturing all relevant models in the summarization map, the code provides a complete and detailed view of the model network. It interacts seamlessly with a database management component to efficiently fetch and process model data, thereby enhancing the system's capability to analyze and visualize intricate model dependencies and relationships. This recursive approach ensures that the summarization map is exhaustive, supporting the system's broader objectives of delivering insightful analyses and visualizations of model networks.",
