    "summary": "The code defines a utility function, `extract_code_content`, which is designed to extract and return the string representation of a given Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) node using the LibCST library. The primary purpose of this function is to facilitate the conversion of a CST node back into its original code format, preserving the exact structure and formatting of the source code. This functionality is crucial for applications involving code analysis, transformation, or refactoring, where maintaining the integrity of the original code is essential. Key components of this implementation include the `extract_code_content` function itself, which accepts a `libcst.CSTNode` as an argument. It utilizes the `code_for_node` method of a `libcst.Module` instance to perform the conversion, ensuring that the output string accurately reflects the original code represented by the CST node. This method is part of the LibCST library, which is specifically designed for parsing, modifying, and generating Python code in a structured and reliable manner.\n\nThe implementation leverages the LibCST library's robust capabilities to handle Python code as CSTs, allowing for precise manipulation and extraction of code content. The use of `libcst.Module([]).code_for_node(node)` is a notable design choice, as it provides a straightforward and efficient way to obtain the string representation of a CST node without altering the node's structure or content. This approach ensures that the function can be seamlessly integrated into larger systems that require accurate code representation. The technical stack is centered around the LibCST library, which plays a pivotal role in parsing and transforming Python code. LibCST is a powerful tool for developers working on code analysis and transformation tasks, as it provides a comprehensive API for interacting with Python code at the syntax tree level.\n\nIn the context of a larger project or system, the `extract_code_content` function could be a component of a sophisticated code analysis or transformation tool. It might interact with other modules responsible for syntax checking, code linting, or automated refactoring. By providing a reliable method for converting CST nodes back to code, this function supports the manipulation of Python codebases while ensuring that the original code structure and formatting are preserved. This capability is particularly valuable in environments where code integrity and consistency are paramount, such as in integrated development environments (IDEs), code quality tools, or automated refactoring systems. The function's ability to maintain the original code's fidelity makes it an essential utility in systems that require precise code transformations and analyses, ensuring that any modifications or analyses do not inadvertently alter the intended functionality or style of the original code.",
