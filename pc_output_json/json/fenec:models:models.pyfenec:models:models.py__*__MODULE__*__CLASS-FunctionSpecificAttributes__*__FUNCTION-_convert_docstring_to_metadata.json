    "summary": "1. **Function Overview**: The `_convert_docstring_to_metadata` function is a utility designed to parse and transform the docstring of a function or class into a structured format. This function is likely part of a larger system that involves documentation generation, code analysis, or introspection. The function's primary role is to extract meaningful information from a doc string and organize it into a structured format, such as a dictionary or JSON, which can be easily processed or queried.\n\n2. **Functionality**: The function likely involves several key steps, including the identification of sections within the doc string, such as descriptions, parameters, and return values. It may employ string manipulation techniques and regular expressions to efficiently parse and extract these elements. The function might also utilize the `inspect` module to access the doc string of a function or class, providing a robust mechanism for introspection.\n\n3. **Purpose and Use**: The primary purpose of this function is to enhance the capabilities of documentation generation and code analysis tools by providing a structured representation of doc strings. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where automated documentation generation is required, as it allows for the consistent and efficient extraction of information from code comments.\n\n4. **Integration and Usage**: Within the context of a larger system, this function could be a critical component of a documentation toolchain. It may interact with other components responsible for storing, retrieving, or displaying metadata, such as a database or a web interface. By providing a structured representation of doc strings, this function can enhance the functionality of the system, enabling it to generate comprehensive and consistent documentation.\n\n5. **Technical Details**: The function likely leverages the capabilities of the `inspect` module to access the doc string of a function or class. Additionally, it may use regular expressions to efficiently parse and extract information from the doc string. The use of these techniques allows the function to handle a variety of doc string formats and extract relevant information in a consistent manner.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Overall, the `_convert_docstring_to_metadata` function plays a crucial role in the automation of documentation generation and the extraction of information from code comments. By providing a structured representation of doc strings, it enables the efficient processing and analysis of code, enhancing the functionality of the system and improving the quality of documentation. This function is an essential component of any system that requires the extraction and processing of information from code, and its capabilities can be leveraged to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of various documentation and analysis tasks.",
