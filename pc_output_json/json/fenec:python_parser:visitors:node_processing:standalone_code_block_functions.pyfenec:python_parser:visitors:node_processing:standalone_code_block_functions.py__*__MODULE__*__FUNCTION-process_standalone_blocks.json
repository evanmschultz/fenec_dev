    "summary": "The code defines a function `process_standalone_blocks` that serves as a critical component in a code analysis or transformation system, designed to convert raw code data into structured models. Its primary purpose is to process a list of standalone code blocks, each represented by a `NodeAndPositionData` object, and transform them into `StandaloneBlockModelBuilder` objects. This transformation is significant as it facilitates further analysis, manipulation, or integration of code blocks within a larger software development or analysis framework. Key components of this code include the `process_standalone_blocks` function, which orchestrates the overall processing workflow, and the `_process_standalone_block` function, which handles the detailed processing and model construction for each individual block.\n\nThe implementation employs a straightforward enumeration loop to iterate over the list of code blocks, assigning a unique sequential identifier to each block. This identifier, along with the provided `parent_id` and `file_path`, is used to invoke the `_process_standalone_block` function. This function constructs a model for each block, encapsulating its structure and metadata, which is then collected into a list and returned. This approach ensures that each block is uniquely identified and contextually linked to its parent module or class, thereby facilitating its integration into the larger codebase for further processing or analysis.\n\nThe technical stack, while not explicitly detailed in the code snippet, likely involves custom data structures such as `NodeAndPositionData` and `StandaloneBlockModelBuilder`. These structures are assumed to be part of a comprehensive system that includes components for parsing, managing, and analyzing code structures. The function's role within the larger project is to act as a bridge between raw code data and structured models, potentially interacting with other components responsible for parsing code, managing identifiers, and integrating with a broader development environment or code analysis framework. This function is crucial for enabling the transformation of code into a format that can be easily analyzed, manipulated, or visualized within the system, thereby enhancing the system's capability to handle complex codebases efficiently.",
