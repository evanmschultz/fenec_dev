    "summary": "The provided code is a method within the `FunctionModel` class, designed to encapsulate and manage metadata for Python functions in a larger software system. The primary purpose of the `convert_to_metadata` method is to transform the attributes of a function model into a structured dictionary format compatible with ChromaDB, a database system optimized for efficient metadata storage and retrieval. This transformation is crucial for systems that require organized and accessible metadata for operations such as indexing, searching, and linking related code components, thereby enhancing the system's ability to manage and utilize function metadata effectively.\n\nKey components of this implementation include two private methods: `_convert_base_attributes_to_metadata_dict` and `_convert_function_attributes_to_metadata_dict`. These methods are responsible for converting the base attributes and function-specific attributes of the `FunctionModel` into dictionary form. The `convert_to_metadata` method then employs Python's dictionary unpacking feature to merge these two dictionaries into a single, cohesive metadata dictionary. This approach ensures that all relevant attributes are seamlessly integrated, providing a comprehensive metadata representation of the function model.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, leveraging Python's built-in data structures and type hinting capabilities. The method returns a dictionary with keys as strings and values as either strings or integers, demonstrating a straightforward and efficient use of Python's typing system to ensure data consistency and clarity. The use of dictionary unpacking highlights Python's expressive syntax for combining multiple data sources into a unified structure, facilitating the creation of a robust metadata dictionary.\n\nIn the context of the larger project, the `FunctionModel` class, including the `convert_to_metadata` method, plays a vital role in the metadata management subsystem. It interacts with other components by providing a standardized format for function metadata, which can be stored in or retrieved from ChromaDB. This integration is essential for maintaining a coherent and interoperable system, where function models can be easily indexed, searched, and linked with other code elements. The class's design, leveraging object-oriented principles and modularity, ensures that it can be extended or adapted to accommodate additional attributes or metadata requirements as the system evolves. Overall, this code contributes to the robustness and scalability of the metadata management framework within the larger codebase, supporting efficient metadata operations and enhancing the system's overall functionality.",
