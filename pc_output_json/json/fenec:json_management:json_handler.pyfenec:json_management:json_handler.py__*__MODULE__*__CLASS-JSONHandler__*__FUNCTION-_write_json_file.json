    "summary": "The code snippet is part of a `JSONHandler` class, which is integral to a system designed for serializing and storing parsed code models into JSON format. This functionality is crucial for managing the conversion of various code components into structured, human-readable JSON files, facilitating data exchange and storage within a software development or analysis pipeline. The `_write_json_file` method is the focal point of this snippet, tasked with taking a `ModuleModel` object—representing a parsed code model—and serializing it into a JSON string using the `model_dump_json` method. This method applies a specified indentation level for enhanced readability, ensuring that the resulting JSON is both structured and accessible. The serialized JSON string is then written to a file at the specified `output_path`, effectively persisting the data for future use or analysis.\n\nKey components of this method include the `module_model` parameter, which is of type `ModelType` and is expected to implement a `model_dump_json` method for serialization, and the `output_path` parameter, which determines the file location for the saved JSON data. The implementation leverages Python's built-in `open` function to handle file operations, ensuring that the JSON string is correctly written to the designated file. This process is part of a broader class architecture that employs a structured approach to file and directory management, utilizing the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module for path manipulations and the `rmtree` function from the `shutil` module for directory cleanup. Additionally, the class incorporates a custom `logging_decorator` to log operations, thereby enhancing traceability and facilitating debugging.\n\nThe technical stack primarily relies on Python's standard library, with `pathlib` and `shutil` playing key roles in path and directory operations. The `model_dump_json` method, although not explicitly detailed in the code, suggests a dependency on either a custom or third-party library for model serialization, indicating the use of external utilities to handle complex serialization tasks. Within the larger project context, the `JSONHandler` class, and specifically the `_write_json_file` method, function as utilities for exporting parsed code models. This capability is essential for systems that require structured data input or archival, as it allows for seamless integration with other components by transforming model objects into JSON files. The class's modular design supports organized storage and cleanup of the output directory, ensuring efficient management of serialized data across various code components, thereby enhancing the overall robustness and scalability of the system.",
