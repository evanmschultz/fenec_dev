    "summary": "This code snippet is designed to efficiently traverse a directory structure and compile a list of all files, excluding those within specified directories, to facilitate streamlined file management and processing. The primary function, `_walk_directories`, is responsible for directory traversal and file collection. It utilizes Python's `Path` class from the `pathlib` module to recursively search through directories using the `rglob` method, which efficiently handles the recursive globbing of files. The function employs a list comprehension to filter out files located in directories specified by the `EXCLUDED_DIRECTORIES` list, ensuring that only relevant files are included in the final list. This filtering is achieved by checking if any part of the file path matches the excluded directories, thus optimizing the file collection process by excluding unnecessary files early on.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, relying solely on Python's standard library, specifically the `pathlib` module, which provides an object-oriented interface for filesystem paths, making the code both efficient and easy to maintain. The use of type hinting with `list[str]` enhances code readability and maintainability by clearly indicating the expected return type.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this function could be integrated into a file processing or data ingestion pipeline, where it serves as a preliminary step to gather input files while excluding those that should not be processed. This selective file gathering optimizes subsequent operations by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the pipeline. The function's design allows for easy integration with other components of the system, such as data parsers or processors, by providing a clean and filtered list of file paths ready for further processing. This makes it particularly useful in scenarios where large volumes of data need to be managed, such as in data analytics platforms, content management systems, or automated backup solutions, where efficient file handling is crucial for performance and resource management.",
