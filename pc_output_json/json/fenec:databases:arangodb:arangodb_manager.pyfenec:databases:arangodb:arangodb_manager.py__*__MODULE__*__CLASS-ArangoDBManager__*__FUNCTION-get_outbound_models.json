    "summary": "This code defines a method `get_outbound_models` within a class, designed to retrieve outbound models from a graph database, specifically ArangoDB, starting from a specified vertex key. The primary purpose of this method is to execute an AQL (ArangoDB Query Language) query that identifies and returns a list of models connected to the given starting vertex, facilitating the exploration of graph relationships. Key components include the method `get_outbound_models`, which utilizes a helper function `create_model_from_vertex` to transform database documents into model instances; and the private method `_get_collection_name_from_id`, which likely derives the collection name from the vertex ID, ensuring the query targets the correct graph collection. The implementation involves constructing an AQL query to traverse the graph and retrieve distinct vertices connected to the starting vertex. It employs error handling to return `None` if the query execution fails or if the cursor is not of the expected type, ensuring robustness in data retrieval operations. The technical stack includes the use of a graph database, specifically ArangoDB, accessed via an AQL query executed through a database connector, and a helper module for model creation, which likely involves custom data transformation logic to map database records to application-specific model instances. In the context of a larger system, this method is part of a data access layer that interacts with a graph database to facilitate model retrieval and manipulation, potentially supporting applications in data analysis, recommendation systems, or network analysis. It likely interfaces with other components responsible for data processing, business logic, and user interface, providing a crucial link between raw graph data and higher-level application functionalities.",
