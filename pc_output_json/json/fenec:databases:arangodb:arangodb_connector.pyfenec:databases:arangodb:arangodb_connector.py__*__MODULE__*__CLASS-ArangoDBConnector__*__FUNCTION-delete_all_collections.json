    "summary": "This code is part of a database management utility designed to manage collections within an ArangoDB database by deleting all user-defined collections while preserving system collections. The primary function, `delete_all_collections`, iterates through all collections in the database and removes those that do not have names starting with an underscore, which is the naming convention for system collections in ArangoDB. Key components include the `delete_all_collections` method, which encapsulates the logic for identifying and deleting non-system collections; the `collections` variable, which holds the result of the database query for collections, represented as a `Result[Jsons]` type, indicating a structured response from the database query.\n\nThe implementation involves a straightforward iteration over the collections retrieved from the database, applying a conditional check to filter out system collections based on their naming convention. The code includes a type ignore comment (`# type: ignore # FIXME: Fix type error`) to bypass a type error, suggesting a known issue with type checking that needs addressing, possibly due to a mismatch between expected and actual data types returned by the `self.db.collections()` method. This indicates an area for improvement in type safety and error handling, highlighting the need for better type annotations or adjustments in the database query method to align with expected types.\n\nThe technical stack primarily involves ArangoDB, a multi-model database known for its flexibility in handling different data models, and Python, utilizing type hinting to improve code readability and maintainability. The use of type hinting, despite the current type error, suggests an intention to adhere to modern Python practices for type safety and clarity.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this function likely serves as a component of a broader database management or maintenance module. It interacts with other components responsible for data storage, retrieval, and possibly schema management, ensuring that only user-defined collections are targeted for deletion. This function could be part of a routine cleanup process or a feature within a larger application that requires dynamic management of database collections, contributing to the overall system's ability to maintain a clean and organized database environment. By automating the deletion of non-system collections, it supports efficient database management, potentially integrating with other administrative tools or scripts that handle database backups, migrations, or monitoring tasks.",
