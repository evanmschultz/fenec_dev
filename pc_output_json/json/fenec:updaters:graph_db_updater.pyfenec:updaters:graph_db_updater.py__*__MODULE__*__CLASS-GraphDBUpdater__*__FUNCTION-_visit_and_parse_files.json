    "summary": "This code snippet is a utility function designed to facilitate the parsing of files within a specified directory, serving as a crucial component in a larger file management or data processing system. Its primary purpose is to initiate and manage the traversal and parsing of files, employing a visitor pattern to systematically process each file in the directory. Key components include the `_visit_and_parse_files` function, which acts as a wrapper to initialize the `VisitorManager` class and invoke its `process_files` method. The `VisitorManager` is a pivotal class responsible for encapsulating the core logic of file processing, including file traversal and parsing, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and modularity. The implementation follows a straightforward design pattern where the function logs the start of the directory parsing process using Python's built-in `logging` module, which is essential for monitoring and debugging the file processing workflow. The technical stack is minimal, relying solely on Python's standard library, particularly the `logging` module, to provide logging capabilities. In the context of a larger system, this function likely interacts with other components responsible for data ingestion, transformation, or storage, serving as an entry point for file-based data processing workflows. Its modular design allows for easy integration and extension within systems that require systematic file handling and processing, making it adaptable to various data processing pipelines. This function's role is significant in ensuring that files are efficiently parsed and processed, potentially feeding into downstream processes such as data analysis, transformation, or storage in a database or data warehouse.",
