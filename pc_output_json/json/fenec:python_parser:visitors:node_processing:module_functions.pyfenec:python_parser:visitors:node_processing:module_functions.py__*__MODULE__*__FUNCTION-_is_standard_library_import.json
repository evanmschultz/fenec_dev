    "summary": "This code defines a utility function, `_is_standard_library_import`, which is designed to determine if a given import name is part of the Python standard library. The primary purpose of this function is to facilitate the identification of standard library imports, which is essential for tasks such as dependency management, code analysis, and ensuring compliance with software distribution policies. The function accepts a single string argument, `import_name`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the specified import is part of the standard library. It leverages the `sys.stdlib_module_names` attribute, introduced in Python 3.10, which is a set containing the names of all modules in the standard library. This allows for an efficient membership check to ascertain the import's status.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward and efficient, utilizing a simple membership test against `sys.stdlib_module_names`. This approach eliminates the need for manually maintaining a list of standard library modules, thereby reducing potential errors and simplifying updates when new Python versions are released. The technical stack is minimal, relying solely on Python's built-in `sys` module, which is part of the standard library itself. This ensures compatibility and ease of use across different environments where Python 3.10 or later is available.\n\nIn the context of a larger project, this function could be integrated into a code analysis tool or a dependency management system. It plays a critical role in differentiating between standard and third-party modules, which can influence how dependencies are managed, reported, or packaged. For instance, in a dependency management system, this function could automate the process of excluding standard library modules from dependency lists, thereby reducing the complexity and size of dependency graphs. Additionally, in a code analysis tool, it could assist in generating more accurate reports by clearly distinguishing between standard and non-standard imports, aiding developers in understanding the external dependencies of their codebase. This utility function, therefore, contributes to maintaining clean, efficient, and compliant codebases within larger software systems, ensuring that dependency management and code analysis processes are streamlined and accurate.",
