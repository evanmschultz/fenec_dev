    "summary": "This code snippet is designed to calculate the total financial cost associated with a text summarization process, specifically for a language model like GPT-4. Its primary purpose is to provide an accurate computation of costs incurred during the generation of text prompts and completions, based on a predefined pricing model. The key component of this code is the `total_cost` property method, which encapsulates the logic for calculating the total cost by considering both prompt and completion token usage. Constants `gpt_4o_2024_08_06_prompt_cost_per_token` and `gpt_4o_2024_08_06_completion_cost_per_token` define the cost per token for prompts and completions, respectively, with the completion cost being four times the prompt cost.\n\nThe implementation involves a straightforward calculation where the number of prompt tokens is multiplied by a fixed cost per token to determine the prompt cost, and similarly, the number of completion tokens is multiplied by a higher cost per token to determine the completion cost. These individual costs are then summed to yield the total cost. The use of the `@property` decorator in Python allows this method to be accessed as a read-only attribute, ensuring that the cost calculation is encapsulated and cannot be modified directly, promoting encapsulation and immutability.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities without external libraries, which makes it lightweight and easy to integrate into larger systems. This code is likely part of a class that manages interactions with a language model API, providing a mechanism to track and report the cost of text generation operations. In the context of a larger project, this functionality is crucial for billing and usage monitoring, potentially interfacing with other components responsible for financial reporting, user account management, or API usage analytics. This integration ensures that users are accurately billed for their usage and can monitor their spending, which is essential for managing resources in applications that utilize language models for text generation. By providing a clear and precise cost calculation, this code supports the financial sustainability and transparency of services that rely on language model APIs.",
