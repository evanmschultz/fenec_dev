    "summary": "This code is a critical component of a model-building framework, specifically tasked with constructing a `StandaloneCodeBlockModel` object by aggregating necessary attributes through a structured and efficient process. The primary purpose of this function is to streamline the creation and configuration of a `StandaloneCodeBlockModel`, ensuring that both common and specific attributes are correctly assembled for its instantiation. This is achieved through the `build` method, which orchestrates the model creation by invoking two essential helper methods: `_get_common_attributes` and `_get_standalone_block_specific_attributes`. These methods are responsible for retrieving and returning dictionaries of attributes that are crucial for the model's construction, with the former providing shared attributes applicable across different models, and the latter supplying attributes unique to standalone code block models.\n\nThe implementation employs a decorator pattern, utilizing a `logging_decorator` to enhance the function with logging capabilities. This decorator logs the process of building the model with a custom message, thereby improving traceability and aiding in debugging efforts. The function leverages Python's dictionary unpacking operator to seamlessly merge the attribute dictionaries returned by the helper methods, ensuring a cohesive integration of attributes into the `StandaloneCodeBlockModel` constructor. This approach not only simplifies the code but also maintains flexibility in attribute management, allowing for easy updates and modifications to the attribute sets as needed.\n\nThe technical stack is minimal, relying primarily on Python's built-in features. The notable inclusion of a custom logging decorator indicates a focus on maintainability and observability within the system, allowing developers to track the model-building process effectively. In the context of the larger codebase, this code functions as a modular component within a model-building framework. It interacts with other components responsible for model configuration and instantiation, contributing to a dynamic and flexible architecture that supports the creation of various model types. This modular design facilitates the extension and customization of model-building processes, aligning with the broader goals of the system to support diverse modeling requirements and enhance the overall scalability and adaptability of the framework. By ensuring that the `StandaloneCodeBlockModel` is constructed with the correct attributes, this code plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the models within the larger system.",
