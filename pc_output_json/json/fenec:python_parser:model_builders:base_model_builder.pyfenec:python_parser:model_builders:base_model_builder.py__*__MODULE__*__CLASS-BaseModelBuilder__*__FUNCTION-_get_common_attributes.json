    "summary": "The code snippet defines a method `_get_common_attributes` within an abstract base class `BaseModelBuilder`, which is a crucial component of a system designed for constructing models of various code blocks, such as modules, classes, and functions. The primary purpose of this method is to encapsulate the logic for retrieving a dictionary of attributes that are common to all code block models, ensuring consistency and reusability across different instances. This method is significant as it provides a standardized way to access shared attributes, which is essential for operations like serialization, configuration, or data exchange between components.\n\nKey components of this implementation include the `_get_common_attributes` method itself, which returns a dictionary of common attributes by invoking the `model_dump` method on the `common_attributes` object. This suggests that `common_attributes` is an instance of a class that supports serialization or data extraction into a dictionary format, likely adhering to a specific interface or protocol within the system. The `BaseModelBuilder` class, which contains this method, is a foundational component that implements the builder pattern, facilitating the structured assembly of code block models with shared attributes and methods. Other methods in this class, such as `set_start_line_num`, `set_end_line_num`, `set_code_content`, and `add_important_comment`, support the incremental construction of these models.\n\nThe implementation leverages the builder pattern, which allows for the flexible and extensible construction of code block models. It uses a combination of lists and dictionaries to manage child builders and common attributes, respectively. The design pattern ensures that the model-building process can accommodate new types of code blocks without altering the existing structure, promoting scalability and maintainability. The use of abstract base classes (`ABC`) enforces the implementation of the `build` method in derived classes, ensuring that all subclasses adhere to a consistent interface.\n\nThe technical stack primarily involves Python's standard library, with a focus on modern Python features such as type hinting (`dict[str, Any]`) to enhance code readability and maintainability. The code implies the use of custom types like `BlockType`, `ImportModel`, `DependencyModel`, `CommentModel`, and `BaseCodeBlockModel`, which are likely defined elsewhere in the system and play a role in representing various aspects of code block models.\n\nIn the context of the larger project, this method and the `BaseModelBuilder` class fit into a system that manages and interacts with multiple code block models. The `_get_common_attributes` method serves as a utility function within this class, providing a consistent mechanism for accessing shared attributes across different code block models. This functionality is essential for the broader system's operations, such as managing dependencies, setting attributes, and constructing hierarchical models of code structures, ultimately contributing to a comprehensive representation of code within the system. This method's role in ensuring attribute consistency is vital for the system's ability to handle complex code structures and facilitate seamless integration with other components, such as dependency management tools and code analysis modules.",
