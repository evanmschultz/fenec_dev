    "summary": "This code is part of a system designed to manage and visualize dependencies within a graph structure, specifically by establishing edges between nodes that represent code blocks. The primary function, `_create_edges_for_dependencies`, is responsible for creating these connections in the graph for a given block's dependencies, thereby facilitating effective dependency tracking and management within the system. Key components include the `_create_edges_for_dependencies` function, which processes a list of dependencies for a specific block identified by `block_key`. It utilizes helper methods such as `_get_collection_name_from_id` to determine the type of nodes involved, and `_upsert_edge` to insert or update the edge in the graph. The implementation iterates over a list of dependencies, extracting the `code_block_id` for each dependency. It uses this ID to determine the source and target types of the nodes, which are essential for defining the relationship between them. The function then attempts to create or update an edge between these nodes, employing exception handling to manage any errors that may occur during this process, ensuring robustness and reliability.\n\nThe technical stack, while not explicitly detailed in the snippet, likely involves a graph database or a similar data structure for managing nodes and edges. This could include technologies such as Neo4j or NetworkX, which are commonly used for graph-based operations. The use of exception handling suggests a robust design pattern aimed at maintaining system stability and integrity, even when unexpected issues arise.\n\nIn the context of a larger system, this function is likely part of a module responsible for managing and visualizing dependencies between code blocks, possibly within a software development or data processing pipeline. It ensures that all dependencies are accurately represented and maintained in the system's graph structure, which is crucial for tasks such as impact analysis, refactoring, and understanding code interdependencies. This functionality is integral to systems that require dynamic and accurate representation of code relationships, supporting developers in maintaining and evolving complex codebases.",
